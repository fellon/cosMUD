0 !! DITTO~
To start this help file out...  Have you ever said anything you meant to go
on a chat or any other channel.  We all have once in awhile.  So there is a
command that will make typing out that sentence to another channel a little
bit easier.
 
'!! <channel>' (This will display your last transmission on that specified 
channel)
 
Here is an example:  (Do not copy any [ ' ].  It is for demonstration only)
 
'say Everyone I will be back!'
'!! chat'
 
It will display:
 
Yakkov chats 'say Everyone I will be back!'
(Of course your name will be in the chat)
 
You can even tell a few people a the same message. (DO NOT SPAM TO EVERYONE)
 
'tell Shogar This works well!'
'!! tell Beth'
'!! tell Ntanel'
 
It will still echo the whole line...
 
Yakkov tells 'tell Shogar This works well!'
 
To see all the channels available, type 'channels'.
~

0 "REMOVE INVIS"~
Syntax: cast 'remove invis' <object>
 
This spell will make an invisible object in the character's inventory
visible.
This is an AGGRESSIVE spell when used on others. I.e, it will attack 
another player if you attempt to use it on them.

1 A~
.                MOVING THROUGHOUT GAME:
                ---------------------------
The game divided into many rooms which are connected by various
directionals to make up areas.  When you are in a room, you can
find the exits in the room by typing EXITS.  Autoexit is a helpful
command to initiate (type CONFIG +AUTOEXIT), because it will
automatically show you what exits there are in the room.  Be warned
however, you will only see the obvious exits.  You must pay attention
to the room descriptions to see if there might be any doors or hidden
passages in the room. 

Directional commands: (in parentheses you find the shorthand)
NORTH (n)    SOUTH (s)    EAST (e)    WEST (w)     UP (u)     DOWN (d)
NORTHEAST (Ne)  NORTHWEST (Nw)  SOUTHEAST (Se)  SOUTHWEST (Sw)
 
Note:  You will notice that in the prompt <20hp 10bp 20mv>, the 'mv'
       refers to your movement points.  If your movement points were
       to run out, you will be unable to move between rooms due to 
       exhaustion.  If you type SLEEP or REST your movement points will
       slowly be replenished.  You must type STAND or WAKE before 
       walking again.
~

111 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
&rWarning&w!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.
~

1 'ACETUM PRIMUS'~
'Acetum Primus,' is the third and most powerful of the known acid
disciplines at the Mage's disposal.  This incantation pulls forth the
strongest caustic agents in the casting Mage's neighboring planes,
and propels them in a tight cyclone-like blast towards the Mage's
chosen victim.  The cross-dimensional disturbance, the physical
violence, and the bonescouring potency of the conjured compound all
work together to effect an estimable estrapade.
~

1 'ACID BLAST' 'BURNING HANDS' 'COLOUR SPRAY' FIREBALL 'LIGHTNING BOLT'
  'MAGIC MISSILE' 'SHOCKING GRASP'~
These are all attack spells and should not be used against another player
unless both you and the other player are listed under 'who deadly' and are
within the legal pkill level range.

1) Syntax:  cast fireball         <victim>
2) Syntax:  cast 'acid blast'     <victim>
4) Syntax:  cast 'colour spray'   <victim>
5) Syntax:  cast 'shocking grasp' <victim>
6) Syntax:  cast 'burning hands'  <victim>
7) Syntax:  cast 'magic missile'  <victim>
 
Each of these spells inflict variable damage on the victim.  The higher the
caster's level, the more damage inflicted.  The spells are listed by their
inherent power from strongest to weakest, though differences in strength
are in many cases minimal.
~

0 'ACID BREATH' 'FIRE BREATH' 'FROST BREATH' 'GAS BREATH' 'LIGHTNING BREATH'~
Syntax: cast 'acid breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'fire breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'frost breath'     <victim>
Syntax: cast 'gas breath'
Syntax: cast 'lightning breath' <victim>

These spells are for the use of dragons.  Acid, fire, frost, and lightning
damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room.  Fire and
frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.

High level mages may learn and cast these spells as well.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
Gas breath is an area attack, the other breath spells are not.

106 ACTIONDESC~
This file is kinda incomplete, if you have more actiondesc's to post, please
tell someone.
 
Action Descriptions (actiondesc) are for edible items.  They make it look
more realistic if you use them correctly.
Action descriptions also work on drink containers.

To add one:
 
oset <item> actiondesc <your description>
 
An Example:
 
oset turkey actiondesc %s eat$q $p.
 
The known actiondesc's:
 
%s = person (If it is you, you see You)
$q = plural (If it is first person, it does not show.  If second, it shows S)
$p = item   (This displays the item that is edible)
~

1 ADRENALINE~
Syntax: adrenaline
Syntax: adren
 
Someone with this skill can control the flow of adrenline through
their veins, allowing them a brief rush of strength and speed,
but afterward they suffer from a period of weakness and exhaustion.
~

111 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

103 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

-1 ADVENTURE~
.
   In our efforts to give credit to everyone who deserves it, we almost
   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.
~

0 AEX AXEXPORT AXIMPORT~
Syntax: axexport path/newfilename.aex
Syntax: aximport path/newfilename.aex
Syntax: aximport path/newfilename.aex newstartvnum

AEX expects a directory called exchange in the smaug or "dist" directory or
whatever directory your mudbase considers its home directory. It actually looks
for "../exchange" from the current directory your mud has changed directories
too when it runs.

AEX will only import and export from this directory, or a directory in 
this directory. example: AXIMPORT dragonbane/darkhaven.aex
  In this case, the subdirectory is the name of mud other than yours.

The reason for creating different directories is because you can put all the
areas from that mud in its import subdirectory with a file called AXSUB.DAT
The AXSUB.DAT file allows you to substitute types, spells, wearlocations,
races, classes and a lot more. From what THAT mud has, to something YOUR 
mud has. For now just edit the AXSUB.DAT file with a text editor. Its pretty
self explanatory, but just in case here is an example of one entry.
        #SPELLS
        'bolt of lightning' 'lightning bolt'
This would substitute the other mud's 'bolt of lightning' spell for your mud's
'lightning bolt' spell.

AXEXPORT requires you to be in the mud and your character located within the 
area that you wish to export. AEX doesn't care what file name you export the 
area to, but for the sake of convention you should end the file with ".aex" 
instead of ".are". For example, if gallery.are starts at vnum 24800 then:
	goto 24800
	axexport gallery.aex

AXIMPORT has an optional 2nd argument which allows the starting vnum
of an area to change on the loading of the area. AXIMPORT can be run from
any room, your character's location does not affect it's usage. So typing
	aximport gallery.aex 30000
would load gallery.aex and the area's first roomvnum would start at 30000.

AXIMPORT creates a log file that has messages in it about flags, races, 
classes , spells, etc. that it couldnt find on your mud. It also may have
warnings about exit words ("n s e north ", etc) being found in room descriptions
without corresponding exits. The log file will be created in the exchange
directory that the imported area was loaded from and will be called areaname.log
In the case of the gallery example above, the log file would be named
	gallery.aex.log

 ~

111 AEXIT AENTRANCE~
Typing AEXIT at anytime will show the rooms, in the area you are in, that are
connected to other areas.
 
Typing AENTRANCE at anytime will show rooms in other areas that connect to
the area you are presently in.
~

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a spells-at-a-glance function, which displays only the spells
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
 
~

107 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.
 
Blind          Invisible    Detect_evil  Detect_invis  Detect_magic
Detect_hidden  **Hold**     Sanctuary    Faerie_fire   Infrared
Curse          **Flaming**  Poison       Protect       Paralysis

   alias nr note read %0
 
And use it by typing:  nr 2
 
You can now make an alias do multiple things by adding ; between commands:
 
   alias test test;cough    This alias will use the test and cough socials.
~

0 ALIGNMENT ALIGN ZAPPING~
Your alignment can range from +1000 to -1000. When you are +1000 this
means that you are good aligned, when you are -1000 this means you are
evil aligned, and when you are 0 aligned this means you are neutral.
You can change your alignment by killing good or evil aligned mobs.
This will raise or lower your alignment.

The different alignments will allow you to wear different pieces of
equipment. If you are good aligned and try to wear a piece of equipment
which is antigood, you will be zapped, which means the piece of eq will
fall to the ground. The same occurs when you are evil and you try to
wear an antievil piece of eq, or if you are neutral and try to wear
an antineutral piece of eq. You can also be zapped during battle if you
are fighting a mob opposite of your align.

You can find out what your alignment is by typing SCORE.

logging in from the site, with a certaing class or race.  If you add the
duration, the ban will expire in that many days. Sites can be banned with the *
wildcard as well.  Be carefull however as *.edu would ban everysite from .edu,
or *foo* would ban anysite that had the string foo in it.

Syntax:  areas <low range> <hi range>
 
The 'areas' command displays an alphabetically sorted list of all areas
within the game, together with the author and suggested level range of
each area.  
 
The 'areas old' command displays an unsorted list of all areas (the old
style), as well as the author and suggested level range of each area.
 
You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested
ranges which encompass the argument.  This can be a little awkward as
each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,
it will be displayed.
 
Special thanks to Fireblade for design and coding of this restyled function.
The Realms of Despair will provide a copy of areas built by individuals
to that individual and no one else. To receive a copy of an area for use
on other muds, you must contact that individual.
 
~

2 ARENA~
ResortMUD features a player killing arena that sheds the pesky rules
usually involved with player killing. Immortals can start an arena
match with the arena command. The syntax is as follows:
  
arena start <entry fee> <min level> <max level>
 
Immortals can prematurely end betting, or an entire match with:
 
arena end
 
Players use the 'arena join' command to enter the arena once a match
has been started, and the 'arena wimpout' command to wimp out of an
arena match.

Betting is also available using the 'arena bet' command. The
syntax is:

arena bet <coins> <player>

Immortals can set how long the betting stage is in minutes using:

arena bet time <minutes>

To see who is doing what in the arena, Immortals can use:

arena who
 
Immortals can be allowed to use the arena if the option is set in
cset. To toggle this option, have an Implementor type
 
cset imm_arena
 
Prizes are awarded in the arena based on the entry fees collected.
500 coins are added to the total, and the last player in the arena
wins all the money.

0 ARIEL ARIELS~
Ariels are descendants of elves born with wings, giving them a beautiful,
angelic appearance.  They tend to be very gentle and charismatic, and
very wise.  Not as strong as true elves, ariels get along well with pixies,
sprites, and other creatures of faerie kind.  They find dealing with the
darker races such as goblins and troglodytes deaming to them, and shun them
whenever possible.

1 ARMOR SHIELD FORCEFIELD 'STONE SKIN' BARKSKIN~
Syntax: c armor <target>
Syntax: c shield <target>
Syntax: c forcefield <target>
Syntax: c stone
Syntax: c bark <target>
 
These spells will give protection to the target from physical attacks.
~

52 ARMORCLASS~
.
&gThere are two values used with armor class for object type Armor:
 
&GValue0: Variable amount based on level of item at repop.
Value1: Maximum repairable armor setting for the object.
 
&gSetting Value0 has no effect. It will re-adjust itself on repop based on
the repop level of the item. Setting Value1 below the expected repop value
for Value0 will result in an item that cannot be repaired until Value0 drops
below Value1's setting. The listing below gives you a rough approximation of 
the values returned for Value0 based on level:
 
&GLevel Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0 
-------------   ------   -------------   ------   -------------   ------   
      1           1-3         10           3-5         20           6-8
     30           8-10        40          11-13        50          13-15
     
&gThe amount that Value0 is set to determines the amount the player's A.C. will
be adjusted. Different wear locations have a different multiplying affect:
 
&G0 X Value0: Wield, Ears.
1 X Value0: Arms,  Finger, Neck, Feet, Hands, Shield, Waist, Wrist, Hold, Eyes.
2 X Value0: Head,  Legs,   About.
3 X Value0: Body.

1 ARTIFACT ARTIFACTS ARTI~
Throughout your travels, you may encounter amazing items out of legend
and story, far more powerful than your everyday equipment.  These items
are known as artifacts.  Artifacts are characterized by the following:

 &z&Y-&z&G They are unique. There should only be one of any given artifact in
   the game at a time.
 &z&Y-&z&G When you log off, you will automatically drop any artifacts
   that you may be carrying.
 &z&Y-&z&G An artifact will save over reboots where it is left.  However,
   this does not prevent a mob or player from finding it and taking it.
 &z&Y-&z&G Artifacts cannot be sold, auctioned, enchanted, or donated,
   and will not scrap during combat.
 &z&Y-&z&G Imms may not keep artifacts, so don't do it.&z&W

The most highly trained and well skilled of assassins is capable of
slipping unseen into places, usually without even alerting the guards of
his or her presence.  If detected, they can often escape without a trace
or dispatch the guards with their fighting skills.  They can slip a knife
into their victims back, or dose them with a deadly poison, for assassins
are masters of poisons and secrecy.  Unlike thieves, their primary
objective is killing rather than stealing, for many hire them to do their
dirty work, and such work tends to pay well.

1 'ASTRAL WALK' 'FARSIGHT' 'TRANSPORT' 'PORTAL' 'HELICAL FLOW'~
Syntax:  cast 'astral walk'  <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'farsight'     <victim>
Syntax:  cast 'portal'       <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'transport'    <victim> 
Syntax:  cast 'helical flow' <victim>
 
These spells allow the very shape of space and time to be warped at the
caster's bidding:
 
'Astral walk' instantaneously moves the caster to the victim's location.
 
'Farsight' allows you to see the room in which the victim stands.
 
'Transport' sends an object in the caster's inventory to the victim.
 
'Portal' forms a temporary tunnel through space to the victim.  A portal
will not succeed if a portal already exists in either the caster's or
the victim's location.  If you able to scry, you can look into a portal
with 'look portal' and 'enter portal' to go into it.
 
'Helical Flow' morphs an Augurer into a coil of colour which instantly
travels to the victim's location.
 
These spells may fail if either the victim or the caster is in a location
which blocks their use, such as no-recall areas, no-summon areas, etc.
 
~

102 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

AT executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile or player, or as the name of an object.

AT works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).

2 ATTACKER ATTACKERFLAG ATTACKERFLAGS~
&PAttacker &Wflags are automatically given by the mud code to players
who engage in illegal attacks upon other players. These attacks can
initiated by using MURDER, casting an attack spell, or ordering
followers to attack a player. Deadlies attacking Deadlies do not
receive Attacker Flags. These flags are only given out in situations
that involve Peaceful players, i.e. Deadlies attacking Peacefuls,
(or vice versa), or Peacefuls attacking Peacefuls. You will be
tagged with an &PAttacker &Wflag if:
 
  1. You attempt to MURDER another player, or they attempt to
  MURDER you. (See &CHelp Murder &Wand &GLaws Pkill &Wfor more info
  on attacking other players).
 
  2. You order charmed mobiles or pets to attack a player, or you
  are attacked by another players mobiles. (See &CHelp Charm &Wor
  &CHelp Pets &Wfor more info)>
 
  3. You are a &RDeadly &Wplayer and attacked a fellow Clanmember.

&WDarkhaven Guards, shopkeepers and special function mobs now respond
differently to illegal flags. You may find yourself barred from making
purchases, placed before Judge Kendra for a hearing, or sentenced to
jail. Should you acquire an &PAttacker &Wor any other illegal activity
flag, see Judge Kendra in Townhall. Her Honour is located one west of
the Main Lobby (See &CHelp Townhall &Wfor info).

1 AUC AUCTION~
.Syntax: auction (abbreviations: a , auc)
Syntax: auction <item name> <starting value>
Syntax: auction bid <value>
 
The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing auction
will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.  
 
If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will 
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it begins at 0 gold.
 
Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item.
 
Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported to SMAUG from a publicly available source.)
 
At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bidded money and the item.  This will at some point be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction unless you're level FIVE or higher. To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.
SEE also "help AUCTION2" for more on auction commands
&Y* Auctions will not be stopped for overbidding or misbidding*&w
~

1 AUCTION2~
Auction will also work with the following arguments:
 
au bid 20k      - bids 20000 coins
au bid 20k500   - bids 20500 coins (20,000 + 500)
au bid 20k5003  - bids 20500 coins, too (only checks first 3 chars after "k")
au bid 1m       - bids 1 million coins
 
On an existing bid of 10000:
au bid +10       - adds 10%, making the bet 11000.
au bid +         - adds 25% (the default if no number given), bet is 12500.
au bid x         - multiplies by 2, making the bet 20000.
au bid x5        - multiplies by 5, making the bet 50000.
 
It is illegal to auction <or barter, sell, trade> clan, order, or guild items.
Exception: Old clan equipment that was converted to be worn by both peaceful
           and deadly players.

0 AUGURER AUGURERS~
The Augurer is very strong-minded in its nature, both physically and
magically. It is very confident of its actions in combat, and this
confidence shows in its physical appearance.  The Augurer is of a
medium height, with a defined bone structure which shows both
intelligence and assurance.  Its appearance is wizened, but at times
the Augurer may look frail due to exhaustion.  Though it is of a
medium size, its physical strength is not.  The Augurer relies on
both brain and brawn to overcome its challengers.  When it is
confronted, its wisdom decides what course of action it should take,
and wisdom is its prime stat.
 
While in combat, the Augurer is capable of utilizing both spells and
skills to their greatest potential.  However, because of the Augurer's
size, it tires of magic easily.  To overcome this mental exhaustion,
the Augurer is a strong believer in the use of mana for rejuvination
of its magical powers, and uses a lot of it.  In its spare time, the
Augurer enjoys the local lore, both the teaching and learning of it,
as well as musical and theatrical pursuits.  The Augurer is a very
independent person, and spends much of its spare time in meditation,
reflecting upon the days activities.

To WITHDRAW, simply go to the bank and withdraw what you need.
 
To see how much you have, type BALANCE, it will show you how much you
have on hand, and how much is in the bank.

For example: barenum 10 and baresize 5 would have the effect of allowing
the mob to hit barehanded for 10-50 damage.

consequences are inflicted on your opponent if it is a player character,

QUAFF quaffs a potion (as opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).
 
RECITE recites a magical scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on the
nature of the scroll.
 
ZAP fires a magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and
you are fighting someone, then that character is used for a target.
 
You must be holding a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.
 
APPLY rubs some of a magical salve on your skin.

All of these commands use up their objects:  Potions and scrolls have a
single charge.  Wands, staves, and salves have multiple charges.  When a
magical object has no more charges, it will be consumed.  Use the spell
'identify' to see the remaining charges.

~

1 'CHARM' 'CHARM PERSON'~
The charm spell, if successful, will place the victim (only mobs, attempts
to charm other player-characters may incur the wrath of the gods) under
your control for the duration of the spell.  While under your control
the creature is your servant, and may assist you in combat and other
more minor duties.  Use the 'order' command to give them orders.
 
Be warned, you are responsible for the actions of your charmed beast.  If
it should go awry and take the life of another player-character, you will
be charged as a murderer and will be hunted by several creatures around
the Realms.
 
Aggressive mobs will lose their aggressiveness while charmed, but will
immediately return to their violent ways when the spell wears off.  For
this reason, charmed aggressive mobs should not be taken into any area
lower from the one from which they came, and should *never* be taken
into Darkhaven or the Academy.  Those found doing so will pay dearly.
 
As a matter of etiquette, charmed mobs should not be attacked.  You can
tell a mob is charmed if it is wandering "in a dazed, zombie-like state."
Be aware when taking your charmed mobs around other characters that any
area attack such as call lightning, gas breath or earthquake will hit
your creature and cause it to engage in combat.

-1 CHEATING~
.
&GCheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur (destruction of
all equipment and public demotion to level 2), deny or even a site ban.
 
What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using gold that was accidentally duplicated
 
Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above. 
 
If you find you have accidentally duplicated an item, turn the item over
_immediately_ to an Immortal.

1 COMBAT~
You may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using LOOK, CONSIDER, and
IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob>
to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indicate how hard a fight might be. You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also CAST IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob.
 
You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many spells and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the spell 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.

1 CONSTITUTION CON~
Constitution (CON in your 'score') represents your character's physical
stamina.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - the number of hitpoints a character receives each time it levels
 
 - the number of hitpoints recovered or regenerated at each tick if
   resting or sleeping
 
 - the number of additional moves a character receives at level
 
 - improvement or worsening of a character's mental state, thus
   affecting general endurance
 
No class receives constitution as a prime attribute.
~

1 'CONTAINERS' 'CONTAINER'~
Containers are almost a necessity in the game.  They are used to carry
items, food, and drinks.  They help you to sort things, by using two or more
types of containers at once.  Corpses use many of the same commands as regular
containers.

EXAM <container> or LOOK IN <container> allows you to see what it contains.

GET <item> <container> allows you to take one item from a container.
GET ALL <container> allows you to take everything from a container at once.
GET ALL.<item> <container> allows you to take all of a particular item type

PUT <item> <container> puts an item inside a container.
PUT ALL <container> will put as much of your inventory in the container as
possible, until the container is full.
PUT ALL.<item> <container> will put as much of one type of item into the
container as possible, until the container is full.
~

53 CONTAINER_FLAGS~

~

0 'CONTROL WEATHER'~
Syntax:  cast 'control weather' <warmer/colder>

1 CORPSE~

When a corpse decays, it will leave the items on the ground.
~

0 COUNCIL COUNCIL2~

MUD.  Immortals can be in two councils at the same time, but mortals

the helpfile pertaining to its name.
 
Also see: COUNCILTALK

~

1 'COVER OF DARKNESS'~
Syntax: c cover
 
This spell is used by darker spellcasters to bring a protective cover of
darkness upon them, cutting all damage given to them in half.  However,
a side affect of this spell is that it blinds the caster with the very
thing that protects him.  Because of the nature of this spell, it will
not work if the caster is carrying a light of any sort.
~

1 'CR' 'CORPSE RETRIEVAL' 'CORPSE'~
Before asking an immortal for a corpse retrieval, you &r-must-:&w
 
&r    -&w Attempt to get your corpse yourself, &rand
    -&w Use invis and hidden, this will get you past a lot of mobiles,&r and
    -&w Seek mortal assistance to retrieve your corpse.&r
    -&g If all else fails, wait at least 20 minutes after death to ask for an
      Immortal corpse retrieval.&w

**  "I need to leave now!" is not grounds for an early Immortal CR.
**  Corpses last approximately 40 - 60 minutes after the time of death.
**  Corpse decay will happen even while you are linkdead or after you quit.
**  Characters listed under 'who deadly' are not eligible for Immortal CR.
**  Corpses _will_ save over crashes and reboots, but will continue to decay
    once the Realms comes back online.  Log back on quickly to get corpse.

The cost for CRs is usually one item from your corpse.  An Immortal may
choose to charge MORE or LESS. 
 
&gAn Immortal corpse retrieval is not a right, but a privilege.&w  Pestering
or being demanding is cause for the Immortal to deny your request.  An
Immortal may refuse to do any CR at their discretion.  You may not barter
which items an Immortal can take from your corpse as the charge, the
Immortal's decision is final.
~

1 CRASH~
Crashes are unforeseen interruptions in the game that cause everyone
to be disconnected. If you type time and look at the system start up
time, you can determine if the game has just rebooted or if it was a
problem with only your character. 
   99.9% of the time corpses will save over a crash. The game will 
start back up with your character at the last place you saved or the
game saved you. 
 
See &WHELP REIMBURSEMENT &w and &WHELP SAVE &w

~

0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown
in the verb used in the damage message.  Damage messages vary depending
on weapon type, or what is inflicting the damage.  Escalating damage is
indicated by the use of _ _ around the messages, regardless of weapon
type.  Messages in all caps indicate even higher degrees of damage,
while those surrounded by * * indicate the highest levels.
 
The message shown will reflect the actual damage you are inflicting on
(or receiving from) your opponent, and not a specific fixed amount.
~

51 DAMPLUS~
.
For those unsure of what damplus is, it is part of the damage
equasion for a mob... ie:  10d6 + 10   (the +10 is the damplus)
This "damplus" is always added, whether or not the mob is barehanded or
wielding a weapon.   This is basically the mob's damroll.
 
~

1 DAMROLL~
Represents the amount of damage you inflict upon an opponent.
The higher the number, the better.

~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the Altar to Thoric in
Darkhaven (or your clan's temple).  Your corpse is left behind where you
were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with
you (the gods want you to have your gold).
 
Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well.  Following/groups are not affected by death.
 
Corpses decay after time. When this happens the items inside a corpse
are left on the ground for any player or mob to come along and take them.
Player corpses will last approximately 30 minutes real time before decaying.
Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.  The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.
 
If you have chosen a deity and have gained enough favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your god for your corpse.  Also see 'help supplicate',
'help deities', 'help favor' for more information on deities.
 
~

1 DEATHTRAP DT~
A "death trap" refers to the scenario where one steps into a room and is
immediately awakened from death with no equipment or corpse. A corpse
recovery is not an option in this case as there is no corpse to retrieve.
 
There are also pseudo death traps that may appear to be a dt, but leave a 
corpse or transfer a corpse to another area. This is not a true dt. 
 
It is often advisable to look before one leaps and heed room descriptions.
DT's do not warrant a reimbursement, they are a part of the game. Gold, 
glory and favor are not affected by a death trap.

1 DEXTERITY DEX~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash and stun, and helps determine whether a thief
   will be able to poison a weapon.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
 
Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves and vampires.

You can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of spells such
as locate object.  To dig an item up, type dig with no arguments.  Having a
shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to dig open an exit.
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and bury <item>.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.
 
* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
          Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)

          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.
~

1 DISARM~
Syntax:  disarm
 
Disarm is an auxiliary fighting command to attempt to disarm your opponent.
Several things affect your ability to disarm or resist a disarm attempt
successfully, including your weapon and your stats compared to the weapon
and stats of your opponent.
 
You can only attempt to disarm your primary opponent, meaning you will be
unable to try to disarm a second or third attacker until you have disposed
of the first.
 
~

1 DISCERN~

those who are hidden in your surroundings.
~

1 DISCLAIMER~
By continuing to play this MUD you are acknowledging that:
(1)  you are willing to abide by the decisions of the Immortals concerning
all issues involved in the game, and
(2)  conversation and situations may arise during the course of play that 
     may not be suitable for young children.

0 'DISPEL EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel evil' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of the gods upon an evil victim.  If you do
not specify a target, the spell's effect will strike you instead of a
secondary target.
~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC'~
Syntax:  cast 'dispel magic' <character>
 
This spell dispels magical affects on the victim.  It may be used as an
offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a benign
spell to completely remove your own magical affects.
 
If you are not a mage, you must be affected by the 'detect magic' to be
able to use this spell.  Though mages do not necessarily need to use it,
being under the affects of 'detect magic' will reveal more information
unavailable otherwise or to other classes.
 
'Dispel magic' can be used by players and mobiles alike against either
players or mobiles.  It cannot remove affects from equipment, your race
or your deity; some other affects are immune to this spell as well.
 
When a caster successfully casts 'dispel magic' on themself they will
remove all of their dispellable magical affects.  If a mage successfully
dispels a victim, the number of affects stripped will depend on their
success and intelligence.  Otherwise a successful cast of 'dispel magic'
on a victim will result in the removal of a single affect each time
(victims will notice when and what affects are stripped).
 
WARNING:  this is an offensive spell, and its use on anyone other than
yourself will be treated as an attack on your target.
 
~

1 DISRUPTION~
With the spell 'Disruption,' the casting Mage causes his opponent to
be enveloped in a weird energy field that momentarily alters the plane
which the victim inhabits.  The spell was an early attempt by the Dark
Mage Thanatos to cause teleportation, but it was a failed attempt.  
Instead of teleporting it causes a horrendous nerve-wracking pain as
the victim exits and reenters his current plane of existence.

~

-1 DROW DROWELVES~
Drow are the darker, more evil cousins of Elves.  They were once part of
the happy community of Elves which roam the forests today, but have long
since moved under the ground, building vast subterranean cities and
complex networks of caves.

Drow have black skin and white hair, and are moderately weaker and have
a more slight constitution than average humans.  Still, like all Elves,
they have a slightly higher dexterity than men.

Members of this race specialize in spell casting, and have thus developed
a very high intelligence.  Being creatures of darkness the Drow tend to
fight more proficiently in the darkness, and have innate infravision with
which to discern objects and living things in the absence of light.
 
Drow gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.08
~

1 DROWFIRE~
Syntax: drowfire <victim>
 
This skill is unique to drow.  With it, the drow may call a misty pink
fire upon its victim, much like faerie fire, which makes the victim
easier to hit as well as preventing him from recalling while affected
by drowfire.
~

0 DRUID DRUIDS~
The druid is a lover and protector of the natural land.  Be it the forests
full of centaurs and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a druid always strives to protect and preserve nature.  Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work.
 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged
lifestyle, a druid has many disciplines upon which to draw.  From powerful
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of nature
which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and split
the sky, druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a hobby, but
a way of life for them.  Able to face many warriors on almost even footing,
and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some mages, druids are
truly a gifted class.
 
~

1 DUST~
Syntax: dust <person>
 
This skill is unique to pixies.  It allows them to sprinkle pixie dust upon
a person, causing them to be able to fly for a time.
~

0 DWARF DWARVES DWARFS~
Dwarves are relatively short (in Human terms), stocky and powerfully-built
creatures.  Long-lived and extremely sturdy, they are known equally as well
for their hardiness as for their cantankerous personalities.  Their thick,
stout frames lend them poor dexterity, but high strength and stamina.  This
race has produced some of the most reknowned fighters.  Dwarves possess the
inherent ability to see in the dark with infravision.
 
Dwarves average from four foot five inches and five feet tall, with dusky
complexions and thick, fur-covered torsos and limbs.  Both men and women
proudly wear and take pride in their beards.
 
Dwarves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.97.
~

1 E~
.              GROUPING WITH OTHER PLAYERS
              -----------------------------
If you are within 5 levels of another character, you have the ability
to group with that player.  You are not able to group a non-deadly
and a deadly character however (see HELP DEADLY). When you are grouped
with another player, you attack mobs together and share the experience
for each kill.
 
Group Commands:
 
  *FOLLOW <player> - you will follow that player at which point they group you
                   - to remove yourself from group type: FOLLOW <your name>

  *GROUP <player> - you add that player to your group
                  - typing GROUP alone will list the people in your group
                  - to remove someone from group type: GROUP <player name>

  *GTELL <message> - you tell the group a message
 
  *SPLIT <amount> - splits the gold among the group

0 EARTHQUAKE~

~

0 EAT DRINK~
Syntax:  drink <object>                  (drink liquid from a drink container)
Syntax:  eat   <object>                  (eat food or a magical pill)
         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.
 
See MENTALSTATES
~

1 EATING DRINKING HUNGER THIRST~
Eating and drinking are very important...
 
If you let yourself starve or dehydrate, your mental state will be affected,
and you may have problems performing even the simplest of tasks.
 
Typing 'score' will give you an indication of your current mental state.
('oldscore' will also show this information)
 
Sitting, resting and sleeping will increasingly contribute to better your
mental state (if done while not starving/dehydrating).
 
Being hurt badly in battle ("That really did HURT", and "You wish that your
wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!") as well as poisoning will also have a
rapid negative affect on your mental state.
 
~

52 ECHO RECHO~
Syntax:  echo      <color> <message>
         echo  imm <color> <message>
         echo  pc  <color> <message>
Syntax:  recho     <color> <message>
 
ECHO sends a message to all players in the game, without any prefix indicating
who sent it.  If 'echo imm <message>' is used, only level 51+ characters will 
see the message. If 'echo pc <message>' is used, only player characters will 
see the message. Echos should always adhere to the guidelines laid out in the 
Realm of Order (vnum 1214).
 
ECHO done in color should avoid the use of red and dark red unless it is a 
Urgent message containing important information related to the game.

RECHO sends a message to all players in your room, without any prefix
indicating who sent it.
 
See also : COLOR 'IMM ECHO'
~

51 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.
 
See ASET, FOLDAREA
~

1 EDITOR~

Tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence and dexterity
of that winged race to a lesser degree.  With a lighter frame than Humans,
what they lack in strength and stamina is made up for with their superior
agility - both in thought and movement.  Elves are capable in all classes,
though they function poorest in the role of pure fighter.  Most Elves will
prefer to stay close to nature, and many become druids.  All Elves have
the inherent ability to detect magic.
 
The average Elf stands taller than most Humans, being well over six feet.
Most have fair skin and long, straight hair, though there are individual
Elves who chose a darker life reflected in their outward appearance.
 
Elves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.1.

51 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

51 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by spell or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~

1 EXPURGATION~
Syntax:  c expurgation

~

0 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL' 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL'~
The Great Wizard Thanatos, after creating his fabled WarMagicks,
found himself snubbed and abused in and about The Realms for his
researches.  Much time would pass before mages and other classes
alike would learn the true power of these spells.
 
In the interim, disguised as an assassin, Thanatos became interested
in a more minor problem: that of carrying off the loot he gained
from all those he slew with Quantum Spike.  Realising that such a
formula would be easily grasped by his class, he thought to extend
it freely.
 
As a final touch to the spell, he thought he would spite those of
other classes by inbuing into these containers a quality which made
them unobtainable by the other classes.

Syntax: follow <character>; Syntax: group <character>; Syntax: group
 
'Follow <char>' starts you following another  character. To stop following,
type 'follow self'.  If someone is following you who you do not wish

follow them, which will make them stop.  This is useful if a member
of your group loses their link or goes afk.
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.

will remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group
does not stop them from following you, however.  A character can also
leave your group by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they
will both leave your group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

~

0 FPROMPT FPROMPTS~
Syntax:   prompt  <string>
Syntax:   fprompt <string>
 
Sets your prompt to a given string.  The game automatically sets your prompt 
when your character is created, but you can use PROMPT to change your prompt
to more to your liking.  If you type 'default' as the string, your prompt
will be set back to the game default.

The fprompt sets your fighting prompt.  This is the prompt that is displayed
to you while you are fighting.  It follows the same format as the normal
prompt does.
Your prompt can be any string of characters that you wish. You can also embed
special characters and tokens into the string that you set. These special
characters are linked with specific groups of tokens. These tokens will add
specific sets of information to your prompt.
 
The first special character is:  %
Tokens for % are:
  %h  - current hitpoints                %m  - current mana (0 for vamp)
  %H  - maximum hitpoints                %M  - maximum mana (0 for vamp)
  %b  - current blood (0 for non-vamp)   %v  - current movement
  %B  - maximum blood (0 for non-vamp)   %V  - maximum movement
  %g  - gold held                        %x  - current experience
  %a  - your alignment                   %X  - experience needed to next level
  %A  - invisible/hide/sneak indicator   %S  - your current combat style
  %c  - remaining hitpoints of enemy     %C  - remaining hitpoints of tank
  
The other special characters are:
 &&  - Foreground color                  ^^  - Background color
 
Examples (assuming current hit points of 43, mana of 23, and movement of 120):
Prompt %h%m%v       =   4323120
Prompt <%h|%m|%v>>> =   <43|23|120>>>
Prompt %h %m %v     =   43 23 120
 
Please see HELP PCOLORS for a list of the color tokens. If you are immortal,
there are separate prompt options for your use. See HELP IMMPROMPT.
~

101 FURNITURE~
To make a piece of furniture, ocreate an object.  OSET the object's short and
long description (If you need help in this area:  HELP OCREATE, HELP OSET).
 
To make the item a usable piece of furniture, set the 'item type' FURNITURE.
Then after doing that, you have to set the values.  The values are listed:
 
Value0 is the number of players that may use the furniture at one time.
 
Value1 doesn't matter, it's used by the code not the builder.  Don't set it.
 
Value2 is a flag stating what the furniture may be used for.  Currently the
choices are:
 
       stand_on stand_at stand_in rest_on rest_at rest_in
       sleep_on sleep_at sleep_in sit_on  sit_at  sit_in
 
I want to make an office chair.  An example would be:
 
ocreate 50522 chair
oset chair short an office chair
oset chair long An office chair is here, ready to be sat on.
oset chair type furniture
oset chair value0 1
oset chair value2 sit_on
(You can use more than 1 use in that chair.  You just have to set each use.)
oset chair value2 rest_in
oset chair value2 sleep_in
(A player can now 'sleep in, rest in and sit on' the chair.)  or you can:
oset chair value2 sit_on rest_on sleep_on (Multiple values work too)
 
The chair is ready to be used, when you are finished with your area for the
day make sure to save your progress.
 
Ostat shows the furniture flags using english words.
 
You must type <ACTION> <FURNITURE> to use the furniture.  You can also use a
preposition between the ACTION and FURNITURE.  Such as 'on, at or in'.  
Optional use:  <ACTION> <PREPOSITION> <FURNITURE>
You must stand to get 'off, out and away' from the object.
 
Any affects that the furniture has, will be temporarily be given to the
person using it. So if you sit in an invisible chair, you become invisible.
 
If the player is sleeping on something, they get +5 added to whatever their
normal regeneration (HP, MOVE and MANA) is.  They get +2 if they are resting
on something.
 
See OCREATE and OSET

The spell 'Galvanic Whip' allows the casting Mage to form in the air
a highly charged rope of air that automatically lashes out at his
opponents in combat.  The Whip may be called once per combat round.
 
~

0 GARGOYLE GARGOYLES~
Gargoyles were originally sculpted of stone to guard a variety of medieval
cathedrals, but at night strong magicks worked on the gargoyles, letting
them take to the skies as if they had always been truly living beings.
But they always had to return to their perch and return to stone again at
dawn, until the gargoyles found a great sorceror who enspelled their race
and allowed them to fly in broad daylight.  Gargoyles are alive, yet not
entirely, having some remnant left of their stoney origins.
~

1 GATE~
Syntax: cast gate

This spell gates in a guardian vampire.  Player characters don't have much use
for it, but high demons, and guardian vampires themselves, like it a lot.
~

101 GHOST INCOGNITO ISCORE~
Syntax: ghost
Syntax: incognito
Syntax: iscore
 
Iscore is a command for immortals only that show immortal stats in
short form.
Incognito makes an imm invisible to people at a lower level then invis
on the wholist.
Ghost makes an imm invisible to people at a lower level then invis in
the same room.

~

0 GITH GITHYANKI GITHZERAI~
The Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago, they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves, stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
 
They had yellowed skin and were very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peered
from yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of naturally detecting
invisible things.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups
recently.  The good, the Githzerai, the selfish neutral, the Pirates
of Gith, and the evil, the Githyanki.
 
Gith gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.06.
~

1 GLANCE~
syntax:  glance
syntax:  glance <victim>
 
Glance alone shows you only the contents of the room you are in,
eliminating the description.  Glance <victim> shows only the health
condition, eliminating their description and equipment from your
screen.
 
Glance may be abbreviated as 'gl'.
~

0 GLORY~
Glory is a measure of how valiant you are, and is accumulated by taking part
in quests (mostly) and possibly in a few other ways in the near to distant
future.  It appears on your score screen as:
 
                    Glory: 264(430)
 
  The number in parentheses is the total lifetime glory attained by your
character, and the other number is your current glory.  Glory can be "spent"
to improve your items and weapons (among possible other things in the future)
as according to the scale detailed in HELP GLORY RATES.
 
   Unlike Quest Points of old, Glory will not only go to the "winner" of the
quest, but will be awarded on a basis of participation.  For example, the big
prize might not only go to the person who killed the monster,  but also to
the person who solved the riddle first, etc.  Players who took part in the
quest and helped a notable amount will also recieve lesser amounts of Glory.
 
   Glory cannot be traded or transferred between characters.  This would be
like Odysseus passing all the reknown for his deeds off onto someone else.

101 GMOTD~
Hedit Gmotd / Hset Save
~

-1 GNOME GNOMES~
Gnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of
races, they are well versed in their studies of knowledges, magics
and religions.  Additionally, due to their familiarity with such
lore, they tend to be more resistant to magics.  They can, though,
suffer tremendously from physical attacks.

Gnomes usually focus in the magical or clerical arts, though a few
rogues have ventured into the arts of thieving (albeit often not
very well.)

Gnomes are a short, stocky race, similar to their dwarven cousins.
Most often prefer an evening at home with a magical tome, a loaf of
pipeweed bread and a cup of ale over venturing out to battle.

Gnomes gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.2
~

0 GOBLIN GOBLINS~
A small and agile race spawned of evil, said to have been originated from
elves captured by dark lords and twisted to serve their needs.  Goblins
do not tend to be friendly toward any but their own kind, even other
creatures of darkness often.  They feud with harpies, raid elven villages,
and torment humans and dwarves just for the fun of it.  They tend to be
none too intelligent, but they are quick and slippery, and can often slip
out of a bad situation.
~

1 GOLD~
Syntax:  gold
 
Displays the current total amount of gold you are carrying.
~

101 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>
 
GOTO takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
or as the name of a mobile, player, or object.
 
If the location is a vnum, and it does not already exist, and its within
your room vnum range, it shall be created for you to edit further with redit.
 
You may also "GOTO pk" to go to the site of the most recent illegal pkill.
 
See also: REDIT.
~

1 GOUGE~
syntax:  gouge
 
This attack can only be used in combat, and will strike at the eyes of
your opponent, causing damage and temporary blindness.
 
Note that gouge has a reduced chance of hitting if the gouger is not
one of the primary combatants (i.e. is not tanking).
 
See also BLIND, BLINDED
~

1 GRASP 'GRASP SUSPIRIA'~
Syntax:  grasp
 
The suspiric grasp is the vampire's most lethal attack, allowing it to
drain the life of its opponent in larger quantities than nearly any
other skill or spell in the Realms.  The more intelligent is the
vampire, the more effectively it will perform this loathsome act.  Be
aware that the magical nature of this attack causes it to be affected
by the victim's saves.

1 GRIP~
This skill is automatic, once practiced.  The skill causes you to grip
your weapon tightly as someone tries to disarm you, making it far more
difficult to successfully disarm you.  This skill will only increase as
you are engaged in fights where someone is attempting to disarm you.

1 GROUNDING~
Syntax:  c grounding
 
Grounding renders the victim resistant to electricity attacks.
This spell may not be used on a target.

Each line begin with the [&wLevel Alignment Class&g] for each char.  Classes
are displayed by their first three letters.  Alignment reads:

-N...-349 to -150   +S...-749 to -350   S...-1000 to -750

&w[hitpnts]&g lists current hitpoints for each character:
          Current hitpoints under 40% of maximum will be displayed in yellow,
          while current hitpoints under 25% will be displayed in flashing red.
&w[ magic ]&g lists current magic points (mana or blood) followed by maximum
          magic points for each character.  Warrior mana is not displayed.
&w[mst]&g     tracks mentalstate.  A normal or near-normal state, where the
          char is neither tired (negative mentalstate) or delirious (high),
          is represented by a === bar.  As mentalstate lifts into delirium,
          sections are replaced with +, the greater the number of +'s the more
          delirious the char.  As mentalstate sinks below into exhaustion,
          sections of the bar are replaced with -, the more -'s the greater
          the character's exhaustion.
&w[mvs]&g     lists current moves only
&w[race]&g    is the character's race.
&w[to lvl]  &gdisplays exp required to attain the next level (non-Avatars only)

1 GROUP GROUPING~
Syntax:  group <character>, group all, group, group disband
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, 'group <character>' again to
remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group does not
stop them from following you, however.  A character can also leave a group
by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they will both leave your
group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows the leader to disband his group (members will stop
following and are ungrouped).
 
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.  See section
10 of your Adventurer's Guide for more information on groups and grouping.

                                      Pkill
 
Here are some sample uses of GRUB:
 
grub 20 pkill=y class=5      Display 20 Druid pkillers
grub 20 level=2 last<=970120 Display 20 L2 players absent since 970120
grub 20 level>=20 level<=30  Display 20 players levels 20 thru 30
grub  0 level=2              Count the number of level 2 players
grub 20 level>50 gold>100000 Display 20 imms with more than 100k gold
grub 50 damroll>100 sex=2    Display 50 females with damroll>150
grub  0 class=5 damroll>150  Count the number of druids with damroll>100
grub 20 site<>123.456.789    Display 20 players from site 123.456.789
grub 10 class=0 race=2       Display 10 dwarven mages
grub  1 name=Joe             Display Joe's info
grub 20 room=7070 class=0    Display 20 mages who logged off in 7070
grub  0 class!=2 class!=3 class!=4   Count the number of mana users
 
You always need to specify the number of lines you want displayed. The
reason for that is that we don't want to ask for a list and then get
surprised to find that it's 15,000 lines long. You can get a count
of the players that match your criteria by requesting zero lines.
 
GRUB will tell you how many lines there are in the list no matter how
many you ask to display. So if there are 15,000 players that meet your
criteria and you ask for the first ten, GRUB will tell you there are
15,000 in total but will only show you the first ten.

~

51 'GRUB EXAMPLES'~
Here are some examples illustrating common usages:
 
Example:
 
grub 20 or hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
Suppose you want to search for "suspicious players". Suppose you want
to see players who have more than 200 million gold or whose damroll
exceeds 150 or whose hitroll exceeds 150 you can do that as follows:
 
Normally GRUB lists players who satisfy all the conditions you specify.
But it can also be used like this to list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
The operand "or" ensures GRUB will list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
If you had specified:
 
grub 20 hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
That would show you players whose hitroll exceeds 150 and whose damroll
exceeds 150 and whose gold exceeds 200 million. It would be a much
smaller list and you would miss many suspicous players.
 
Example:
 
grub 20 name>ska name<skb room>=21000 room<=21499
 
Suppose someone complains that a player with a name like "Skathamaga"
picked up some of their eq and promptly quit the game. The player isn't
sure of the exact name of the thief but is sure it starts with "Ska".
The thief quit the game somewhere in New Darkhaven (vnums 21000-21499).
 
This example will show you players whose name starts with "Ska" and who
last quit the mud somewhere in New Darkhaven.

Syntax: grub # <or> field operator ## <field operator ##>
Where:  &g#         &GAny valid number.
        &g<or>      &GUsed with multiple expressions to denote that only one of
                  them need be true.
        &gField     &GName, Sex, Class, Race, Level, Room, Gold, Hitroll,
                  Damroll, Site, Last, Pkill.
        &gOperator  &GValid operators are:   =   !=   >   <   >=   <=
        &g##        &GNumeric except for Name and Pkill. For name it is a full
                  or partial name. For Pkill it is a Y or N.
 
&GLast is:  &WExpressed as "YYMMDD". ie, 970122 is Jan. 22/97.

          5 Vampire  6 Half Ogre  7 Half Orc  8 Half Troll  9 Half Elf
         10 Gith&w
&GYou can have more than one conditional expression in a Grub search. "And" is
assumed unless "or" is placed before the arguements. ie:
&W    Grub 10    class=3 sex=2    (Gives back a list of 10 female warriors)
    Grub 10 or class=3 sex=2    (Gives back a list of 10 characters that
                                 are either female, or warriors).
You must always specify how many lines the Grub will produce. This prevents
your getting a list 15000+ lines long.

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
 
All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~

2 GUESTLIST IMMLIST WIZLIST~
Syntax: wizlist
Syntax: immlist
Syntax: guestlist
 
These show you the staff/immortals and thier ranks on this MUD.
Guestlist is available for levels 2 and up only.

101 GWHERE GFIGHTING GLOBALS~
Here are some global commands that are great on spoting Mortals at their best:
 
Typing GWHERE will show where every player is at the time.
Typing GFIGHTING will show any player conflicts happening.
 
You can also use variables in the query, to get more specific results:
 
gwhere <low level> <high level>
This will show only a specific range of players.
gwhere <low level> <high level> mob
This will show a specific range of MOBs at that level.
NOTE:  Do NOT use a long range for MOBs.  The best results if you go 1 or
2 levels above the low level.  If you do a long range, it makes bugs.
(IE:  If your low level is 1, then make your high level 2 or 3; to avoid bugs)

gfighting <low level> <high level>
This will show only a specific range of player conflicts.
gfighting <low level> <high level> mob
This will show a specific range of MOB conflicts at the levels provided.
NOTE:  This is the same as GWHERE.  Avoid a LONG RANGE of MOB conflicts.
 
There should be no problems if you use these per the HELP file.

~

0 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALFELVES~
These beautiful creatures are the result of the mixing of human and Elven
blood.  Though the resulting Half-Elf is not as intelligent as the pure-
blooded Elf, nor as hardy as the full-blooded Human, this mix serves quite
well in a variety of classes which require the standards of both mental
and physical prowess.  Their beautiful almond eyes enable them to discern
objects in the darkness.
 
Not as tall as the pure Elf, they range from five feet six inches to six
feet five inches, with a heavier musculature than their ancestors.
 
Half-Elves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.04.
~

0 HALF-OGRE HALFOGRE~
The Half-Ogre is a result of breeding during the dark days with humans,
when pure-blooded Ogres were known for raping and looting Human villages.
As a result of this, the Half-Ogre stands from six to nine feet tall in
height and is known for its muscle-packed body that can weigh from three
to four hundred pounds.  Most are relatively hairless, their bodies are
covered with small, boney growths, and their disproportionately long
limbs gives them a somewhat simian appearance.
 
This offspring of humans and Ogres has inherited great physical abilities:
an apptitude for aggression from its Ogre lineage, inherent infravision to
assist in traversing darkness, and though slightly smaller than pure-bred
Ogres it nevertheless boasts an awesome strength.  Being territorial, most
Half-Ogres will readily engage in battle to establish superiority over any
it encounters.  All in all a race best suited for the role of pure fighter.
 
Half-Ogres gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.92.
~

0 HALF-ORC HALF-ORCS HALFORC HALFORCS~
A recent mingling of Orcish and Human blood arising as the darker races
have encroached further upon the remaining settled areas, most members
of this half-blooded race are distinctly more Orcish than Human in both
appearance and behavior.  Large and dull of wit, with short but broad
bodies, their poor mental and physical dexterity is offset by an iron
constitution.  Though some have dabbled in the sorcerous arts due to
their human influence, brute combat is is still the natural call which
stirs in the soul of the Half-Orc.  All Half-Orcs possess infravision.
 
Though not as broad nor powerful as full-blood Orcs, Half-Orcs usually
retain their wider bodies, longer, bowed limbs and heavier musculature.
A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals small, squinting eyes;
below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with crooked fangs; dark
skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts civilized races.
Standing from five to seven feet tall and averaging two hundred pounds,
an altogether fearsome race.
 
Half-Orc's gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.94.
~

0 HALF-TROLL HALFTROLL~
An intermingling (carried out in the darker lands of the Realms) of the
blood of the Troll with that of Humans, the Half-troll is as deadly as
it is hideous.  Though considerably smaller than full-blood Trolls, the
Half-troll often stands well over eight feet in height and carries over
three hundred pounds on its heavily-muscled frame.  Though naturally of
low wisdom, the race was sorcerously imbued with a wicked intelligence
and the ability to see naturally in the darkness.  Half-trolls usually
make poor pure magic users, and suffer from an unusually low dexterity.
Yet their boundless energy and high intellect create one of the most
cunning physical beasts of the Realms in experienced hands.
 
Owing in part to the black blood which courses through their heavy veins,
the heavily-scaled skin of the Half-troll ranges in color from a charcoal
grey to a deep, blackish green.  Half-trolls revel in the fright of their
appearance, often wearing their hair in battle-braids and emblazoning
themselves with brands and tattoos to accentuate the effect.
 
Half-Trolls gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.90.
~

0 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
Stout, round, open-minded and very elusive the Hobbit has a level
of dexterity which is only equal to his wit. Many enjoy the thrill of
reading a good book, or telling stories by the fire. Many halflings,
because of this, tend to avoid adventuring, though some rare hobbits
choose the path of the Bard, or storyteller, for their keen intellect
serves them well. This intelligence, coupled by a surprising
determination makes them a curious (though somewhat underpowered)
ally.

Halflings have compact bodies and thick, long limbs, and usually have
very hairy feet. Eye color range from blue, brown, green, and any shade
inbetween.

Halflings gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.02.
~

1 HALLUCINATION~
Syntax: cast hallu <victim>
 
This spell will heighten the victim's mentalstate, causing them to see
things and interfere with their actions.
~

-1 HARASSMENT~
.
&GHarassment is giving a person unwanted attention, whether you perceive it
as negative or positive attention.  If a person is made to be uncomfortable
by your attention or comments, you are harassing that person.  If a person
asks you to desist in talking to them or performing socials on them, and
you do not stop, you are harassing that person.  If you act in an intimate
manner to a character, without their permission, you are harassing that
person.
 
No form of harassment is tolerated in the Realms.  We especially frown upon
unwanted comments or actions with a sexual nature or explicit content.  If
you do not have an intimate relationship with the person, whether in real
life or within the Realms, you should refrain from using suggestive actions
and/or comments.
 
If you are caught harassing another player in any way, you can be silenced,
helled, frozen, denied, and/or site banned.  Harassing another player is a
serious violation of the rules and will not be permitted.  If you choose
to harass an immortal, you will simply be deleted.
 
~

0 HARPER HARPERS~
Harpers revel in the magic of music, and are capable of singing songs that
can produce effects comparable to those of any mage.  They enjoy music even
only for entertainment, but their true power is in their magical instruments
only a select few among their races know how to make, which can allow any,
harper or no, the power of harper songs.  When they sing, their songs bring
magic to those who hear.  They need to be rather intelligent to memorize
the correct notes, as well as needing a good amount of dexterity, for
the actual playing of the music.
~

0 HARPY HARPIES~
Harpies are part human and part bird, having the wings and talons of a
vulture and the head and arms of a human.  They are considered by many to be
vile, evil, and filthy creatures who love nothing better than to watch
a human die for a good laugh.  They tend to live in flocks, and feed on
carrion when they cannot get fresh meat.  Most of the goodly races avoid
them whenever possible.
~

1 HASTE SLOW~
Syntax: c haste <target>
 
This spell allows the target to move at an accelerated pace, getting
more hits in per round than usual.
 
Syntax: c slow <victim>
 
This spell causes the victim to move at a sluggish pace, getting
half as many hits in per round as usual.
~

1 HEADBUTT~
Syntax:  headbutt
 
Headbutt is a skill which can only be used once a fight has started,

lands, it inflicts damage on your opponent.

54 HEDIT~
Syntax: hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you. The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name> 
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated 
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player's prompt. &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors. However there are a couple of quirks to take 
note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems. 
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the 
help file. Tact and restraint should be used if considering the use of colors.
 
 
See HSET, PCOLORS.

105 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>".
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours".  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.
 
You may not hell someone for more than thirty days with the hell command.
 
To release a player from hell, simply "unhell <character>".

~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible

51 HITALL~
Syntax: hitall
 
Hitall is a fighter skill that will start a fight by hitting all the
opponents in the room.  For nondeadly characters, the 'opponents' means
mobs, for deadlies it means all the deadly players in the room.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
~

1 HITROLL HR~

~

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.
~

1 'HOLY SANCTITY'~
Syntax:  c 'holy sanctity'
 
This spell casts sanctuary on every member of the cleric's group.
~

51 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

1 HOMEPAGE~
syntax: homepage <url>
 
example: homepage http://www.idirect.com/test.html
 
If you have a web page somewhere, you can use the homepage
command to show people a link to that page whenever they
select the 'see who's on' link from this MUD's home page.
 
To remove your homepage setting, type 'homepage clear'.
 
~

1 HOWL~
Syntax: howl
 
This skill allows a werewolf to let out a bloodcurdling howl
that due to the fear it strikes in the werewolf's opponants gives
strength and speed to the wolf, allowing them to hit more often
and harder than usual.  The howl has two effects, the wolf's fury and
strength.  After the fury is gone the strength will remain for a time,
during which the wolf cannot bring the fury back until the
wolf's strength returns to normal.
~

57 HP~
This is an abbreviation for hit points.  All classes begin with 20 hp
at creation and gain between 6 and 40 hp per gained level, depending on
CLASS, RACE, and CON.  Equipment can also add to your total hp.
~

111 HSET~
Syntax: hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

Setting a help entry level to -1 prevents the header from showing up 
when you view the help with the help command.

0 HUMAN HUMANS~
.
HELP HUMAN HUMANS

In the beginning there were Humans, Elves and Ogres. Humans are the most
numerous and the plainest race in the Realms. Although possessing no special
abilities or bonuses, they are the most adaptable and flexible race and are
able to assume any class. Humans are bipedal creatures with two arms 
and a roundish head. Their height, weight, eye and hair color vary greatly. It
is rare to find any two who look exactly alike. In dark times Humans and Elves
mated creating a new race, called HALF-ELVES (see help HALF-ELF HALFELF) and
Humans and Ogres mated created the Half-Ogre Race.  (See help HALF-OGRE, or
help HALFOGRE)

100 I3~
Syntax:

For Everyone:
i3 chanlist [all] [filter]
i3 mudlist [filter]
i3 listen <localchannel>
i3 chanwho <channel> <mud>
i3 mudinfo <mud>
i3 ignore <person@mud>
i3 invis

For Administrators Only:
i3 stats
i3 chanlayout <channel> <message> <emote>
i3 setup <channel> <localname> [level]
i3 addchan <channel> <type>
i3 removechan <channel>
i3 chanadmin <localchannel> <add|remove> <mudname>
i3 connect
i3 disconnect
i3 savechan
i3 debug

These are the configuration commands for Intermud-3.

I3 IGNORE allows you to selectively ignore users at certain muds.
You will effectively be invisible in all ways to them, with the
exception of public channels. They will not see you on who, finger,
or locate, and they will not be able to beep you.

I3 INVIS toggles your invisibility state. If you are i3invis, then
nobody on I3 can locate you or send tells, beeps, etc.
You will NOT however be made invisible for channels. If you use
a public channel, then people will see you on them. This is more
or less equivalent to an UberIgnore.

I3 CHANLIST gives an overview of all channels available on the
Intermud-3 network, the option "all" will give all channels instead
of the subscribed only and the option "filter" will display all
channels which prefix the string.

I3 MUDLIST gives an overview of all muds connected to the Intermud-3
network, the option "all" will also show the ones which are down
right now and the option "filter" will show only those which prefix
the string.

I3 CHANWHO gives an overview of all people on a certain mud
listening to the channel specified.

I3 MUDINFO gives information about a mud on the Intermud-3 network
with information as given by the Intermud-3 router to the mud.

I3 LISTEN will let you listen to a channel. To talk to the channel
use the name of the channel as the command.

100 I3EMOTE~
Syntax i3emote <name>@<mud> <message>

An Intermud-3 command:

Sends a private emote to a person on another mud.

See also: i3, intermud3
~

100 I3FINGER~
Syntax i3finger <name>@<mud>

An Intermud-3 command:

Requests for information regarding a player on a mud.
Operates in a similar manner to the local 'finger' command.
Will only reveal information the target mud feels is appropriate.

See also i3, intermud3, finger
~

100 I3LOCATE~
Syntax i3locate <name>

An Intermud-3 command:

Requests on all the muds on the Intermud-3 network if a person
known by the name is there. Be patient when using this command,
there are a lot of muds on the network to search through, so
a response may take some time to come back.

See also: i3, intermud3
~

100 I3TELL I3REPLY~
Syntax: i3tell <name>@<mud> <message>
Syntax: i3reply <message>

An Intermud-3 command:

i3tell sends a private message to a person on another mud.
Due to limitations in the code, you can only use a one word
mud name to target the tell to. Otherwise this command operates
in much the same way as the local tell command.

To reply to the last i3tell you received, simply type 'i3reply'
followed by your message and it will be sent back to the last
person on I3 who sent a tell to you. Works in the same manner
as the local reply command.

See also: i3, intermud3, tell, reply
~

100 I3WHO~
Syntax i3who <mud>

An Intermud-3 command:

Requests an overview of players on a different mud.
Operates similarly to the local who command.

~

112 ICE~
The IMC Channel Extensions protocol
 
ICE is a response to the cesspool-like attributes that rchat, rimm, and
even rcode have acquired over the last few months. It is IRC-ish in some
ways, but hopefully it will be used more constructively than IRC.
 
For a quick introduction and setup guide for ICE, see ICE-INTRO
 
The basic ICE structure is (greatly simplified):
. Some nodes on IMC - normally hubs - run channel daemon code that
  manages channels
. Each of these nodes maintains a list of the channels they manage, and
  the various attributes of them - who owns them, and so on
. The daemons regularly tell all muds on IMC what channels they have, and
  what their attributes are
. Based on this information, the muds on IMC decide which of their local
  users can use which ICE channels. If one mud is modified to ignore these
  restrictions, then the other muds will recognize this (since they, too,
  know the restrictions) and ignore messages from that mud.
 
Every channel on ICE is of the form nodename:channelname, for example a
channel called hub2:IAdmin is the channel IAdmin maintained by the node hub2.
 
Each mud picks which channels it is interested in (see ILIST and
ISETUP) and creates a local channel name which can be used to talk on
that channel.
 
Generally, any admin on a mud can create a channel on any node - although
nodes can be configured to restrict who can create channels. Whoever
creates a channel owns it, and can control who can use that channel (in
whatever way they wish). The trick, of course, is to persuade the admins
of other muds that your channel has value. Creating and modifying a
channel is done via the ICOMMAND command.
 
Channels can be tuned into and out of on a player-by-player basis by

There are a variety of ways of controlling who can hear and use a channel
- see ICE-POLICY for more information.

112 ICE-INTRO~
A Quick Introduction to ICE
 
This assumes that the code for IMC and ICE is installed and running, and
that you have an active connection to an IMC network.
 
1. ILIST. This will give you a list of possible channels to choose from.
   Pick one that you want to add, that has a policy of 'open'. Note its
   name (of the form node:channel).
 
2. Decide what command you want to use to speak on this channel on your
   mud. This is the channel's localname.
 
3. Type: ISETUP ADD <node:channel> <localname>
 
4. You should now be able to use the channel. Others can listen to and
   speak on the channel by using ICHAN <localname>.
 
5. You may wish to reconfigure the default local channel settings.
   ILIST <localname> will display them; ISETUP will change them.
 
6. Repeat for whatever other channels you wish to have.

1 ICE-POLICY~
Channels can have one of three policies - open, closed, and private. They
also have one owner, and zero or more operators (assigned by the owner).
They also have an include and exclude list (which can specify both
individual players ['user@mud'] and entire muds ['mud']), which can be
modified by the owner and the operators.
 
- Open. The channel can be accessed by all muds on the network (it is a
  broadcast channel). People on the exclude list cannot use the channel,
  with the exception of people also on the invite list. This means, for
  example, if an entire mud is excluded and one player is invited, that
  player can use the channel, but the rest of the mud can't.
  
- Closed. The channel can be accessed by all muds on the network (it is a
  broadcast channel), but by default they will not hear or be able to use
  it. People on the invite list can use the channel, with the exception of
  people also on the exclude list.
 
- Private. Identical to closed, except that the channel is actually only
  physically sent to those muds that are on the invite list. This is good
  for channels specific to a small group of muds, and not of interest to
  the majority of the network.

0 ICESHIELD~
This spell will surround you with a shield of ice, that will return your
enemies attacks with tongues of ice!
~

1 ICESHIELD FIRESHIELD SHOCKSHIELD~
Iceshield conjures an encompassing shield of ice which will return the
attacks of your enemy with tongues of cold.
Syntax:  cast iceshield
 
Fireshield surrounds the caster with a wall of fire which returns your
enemies' attacks with balls of fire.
Syntax:  cast fireshield
 
Shockshield surrounds the caster with a field of electric energy which will
return your enemies' attacks with bolts of lightning.
Syntax:  cast shockshield
 * shockshield cannot be cast on others
 
 
The chances of your shields striking your opponent increase with your level,
with the odds at low levels being very low.
 
Like shields will negate each other's effects.  For example, if your enemy
has fireshield, your fireshield will counter any fireballs thrown by his,
and his will counter any fireballs thrown by yours.
~

112 ICHAN~
Syntax:  ichan               - display current ICE channel status
         ichan <localname>   - toggle an ICE channel
 
IChan lets you show and toggle which ICE channels you are listening
to. Without arguments, it will show you the channels you belog to; with
an argument, it will turn on or off that channel.
 
Any channels you listen to must be locally configured first - see
ISETUP. ILIST can be used to see available channels.

~

113 ICOMMAND~
Syntax:         icommand <command> <channel> [<data..>]
 
Commands:         create <channel>           - create a channel
                  refresh <channel>          - refresh channel data
                  list [<channel>]           - list available commands
                  destroy <channel>          - destroy a channel
                  policy <channel> <policy>  - change channel policy
                  addop <channel> <name>     - add a channel operator
                  removeop <channel> <name>  - remove an operator
                  invite <channel> <name>    - add an invited name
                  uninvite <channel> <name>  - remove an invited name
                  exclude <channel> <name>   - exclude a name
                  unexclude <channel> <name> - remove an exclusion
 
ICommand is used to send commands to a channel daemon elsewhere on IMC.
It directly affects the channel itself - any changes made here will
affect all muds using the channel.
 
Since the actual commands are interpreted by the channel daemon, not your
mud, what is available may vary. To get a list of available commands, use
 
- icommand list <nodename> for public commands, or icommand list
  <node:channel> to see what commands you have for that channel.
- icommand refresh asks the daemon to refresh your mud's information for a
  channel, if it ever gets out of synx. Asking for a refresh of nodename:*
  will refresh all channels on that daemon.
- icommand create creates a new channel, with you as the owner
- icommand destroy destroys a channel. You must own the channel.
- icommand policy changes the basic policy of the channel (see ICE-POLICY).
  You must be the owner.
- icommand addop/removeop add and remove operators from a channel. You must
  be the owner, and specify the operator's full user@mud name.
- icommand invite/uninvite/exclude/unexcluded modify the invite and exclude
  lists for a channel. You must be the owner or an operator on the channel.
  Either a full user@mud or a simple 'mud' name (no @) can be specified.

1 IGNORE~
Syntax:  ignore
Syntax:  ignore <character>
Syntax:  ignore reply/none
 
Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in the Realms.  All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out).  You will still see their communications through public channels,
however.
 
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.
 
Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.
 
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.
 
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.
 
~

112 ILIST~
Syntax:  ilist               - list all known ICE channels
         ilist <channel>     - list details on one ICE channel
 
 
IList displays information on channels active on ICE.
Without arguments, it will produce a display similar to:
 
Name            Local name      Owner           Policy
hub2:IAdmin     IAdmin          Nemon@AR        open
hub2:ICode      ICode                                    (inactive)
hub2:test       (not local)     Nemon@ARtest    private
 
This shows the canonical name (eg. hub2:IAdmin), the local name (eg IAdmin
 
- which can be used as an abbreviation in ISETUP, and which is also
the command to speak on that channel), the owner of the channel (eg.
Nemon@AR), and the channel's policy (see ICE-POLICY).
 
If a channel is not configured locally, it will have (not local) for its
local name.
 
Continues with: ILIST2 
~

112 ILIST2~
If a channel is configured locally, but is not actually active on IMC, it
will have an (inactive) flag on it.
 
IList with a channel name will provide detailed information on that
channel. For example:
 
Channel hub2:IAdmin:
  Local name: IAdmin
  Format 1:   (IAdmin) %s: %s
  Format 2:   (IAdmin) %s %s
  Level:      102
 
  Policy:     open
  Owner:      Nemon@AR
  Operators:  Drylock@AR
  Invited:    NiceGuy@SomeMud
  Excluded:   SomeMud
 
Continues with: ILIST3
~

112 ILIST3~
This displays the channel name, local name, policy, and owner, as above. It
also displays:
 
- the minimum level needed on your mud to see the channel
 
- the format for displaying messages from the channel. These can contain
  any color codes etc. that your mud uses.
 
Format1 is the string displayed when someone speaks normally on the
 
  channel - the first %s is replaced by their name, the second %s by what
  they say.
  
  Format2 is a similar string for emotes. Again the first %s is their name,
  the second %s the text of their emote.
 
- any operators for the channel. This can only be changed by the owner of
  the channel. Operators can modify the 'invited' and 'excluded' fields
  via the ISETUP command.
 
- the invited and excluded people on the channel. See ICE-POLICY for
  more details.

1 'ILL FORTUNE'~
Syntax: c 'ill fortune' <victim>
 
Ill Fortune reduces the victim's luck by three.
~

0 ILLUSIONIST ILLUSIONISTS~
Wizards of trickery, masters of illusion.  They are capable of producing
many fantastic visual effects and know a very few spells that are capable
of creating tangible effects for a short time, but their medium is primarily
the eye, and tricking the mind into believing in what is not really there
or concealing what is truly there.  As such, they tend to be thought less
of than a true mage, but illusionary magic tends to be easier and faster
to learn than elemental magic.
~

2 IMAIL~
'IMC NOTES' 'IMC NOTE' 'IMC MAIL'
 
Notes {boards, mail, etc} are very mud-dependent, but in general, if
they have been connected to IMC, then you can simply write notes to
player@mudname in addition to normal 'player'.
 
For example, you may be able to do:
 
note to abcde@somemud anotherplayer immortal@somemud
 
and the note would go to:
 
- abcde on the mud called 'somemud'
- anotherplayer on your mud
- all immortals on the mud called 'someothermud'
 
The 'playernames' used are interpreted by the mud that receives them,
not your mud, so be careful when writing notes to group names such as
'immortal'.
 
If your note cannot be delivered within 12 hours for some reason (if the
mud is down, does not exist, or refused your mail) then you will get a note
from the system telling you so.

1 IMC~
(Inter-Mud Communication) provides a way for muds to connect together and
share various services: chat channels, tells, notes, who listings, and so on.
 
The available mortal-level IMC commands are as follows. See the help topics
for each of these for more information.
 
- IMCLIST : get a list of active muds that are connected to IMC.
- RWHO    : send a who request to a mud.
- RTELL   : send a tell to someone on another mud.
- RREPLY  : reply to a rtell from someone on another mud.
- RQUERY  : ask for information of some type from another mud.
- RBEEP   : "beep" another player. Use sparingly.
- RWHOIS  : find someone on IMC

56 'IMM AUTH' 'IMM AUTHORIZE'~
Associated help files: authorize
 
Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
  continue in the Spectral Gate pre-auth area, but will make them choose
  a new name prior to entering the Academy.  Use this command if the name
  is questionable, modern, or rude.  If the name is acceptible, but in all
  caps, accept the name, but send them a tell requesting they not use all
  caps for their name in the future.
 
Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once this
  command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands to enter
  the Realms.
 
Authorize <player> no -- This command is exclusively used to deny players
  with extremely rude or profane names and banned sites.  Use this command
  sparingly.
 
Levels 51-54 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure their are not any
players waiting for authorization.  The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if an name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it.  If you are in doubts to a names acceptibilty, but it is not profane or
extremely modern, you should probably accept it.
~

55 IMMHOST~
Syntax:  immhost add    <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost delete <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost save
Syntax:  immhost
This command is for setting the hosts allowed for immortals that are added
with this command.  Wildcards are allowed (*), so *edu, would allow any domain
from edu connect and 127*, would allow any local domain to connect.
IMMHOST without arguments will show a list of names and what domains they are
allowed to connect from.
To delete a command you need to provide the name and the host, this allows
for multiple hosts for a certain name.
This file won't be saved until the immhost save command is issued.

51 IMMRULES~
.                            * Immortal Rules *
 
     These following rules are for the immortals of ResortMUD.  
 
NOTE:  These rules apply to immortals of level 51 - 60.
     
1.      You should not have contact with mortals unless assistance is  
        required.
2.      You will not restore, adjust stats, alter or equip mortals. 
        Only exception is for mortals under level 6, use newbieset.
3.      You have no authority in law enforcement of this MUD. Report 
        all infractions to a senior immortal.
4.      You will be given a grace period to learn your immortal trade
        on this MUD. If you do not learn it withing a few days, you
        will be returned to mortal status.
5.      You will be assigned an area for use of constructing an area 
        to be placed in this MUD. If you succeed in construction 
        steadily and reach a large sum of room space, you will be 
        promoted. Do not asked to be promoted before then. Quality and 
        quanity is what we seek in an area. 
6.      If you feel you have completed your area, have a senior   
        immortal look the area over and make a decision about your
        area and its future.
7.      Do not continually harass others, mortal or immortals, in 
        anyway. If you are considered to be a pest as an immortal, you
        will be demoted back to mortal status and mortal rules will
        apply.

~

1 INFRAVISION INFRARED~
Syntax:  c infravision
Syntax:  c infravision <character>
 
This spell enables the character to detect the heat signatures of other
players and creatures in the room with them.  This spell will also allow
you to find items in corpses, containers, etc. but will not allow you to
view the actual contents.
 
You must have a light source to actually see items, room descriptions,
the contents of corpses or containers, room exits and the like inside
a darkened area.
 
~

0 'INNER WARMTH' INNER WARMTH~
Syntax: c inner <target>
Syntax: c warmth
 
These spells will make you resistant to all forms of coldness.
Inner warmth may be cast on yourself or others but only affects a
single target.
Warmth affects all members of the caster's group.
~

59 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax: installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.
The filename can be fixed with aset, (don't forget to foldarea the new name.)

Currently the builder should quit and have his/her vnums cleared manually.
(This should be fixed soon).
~

54 INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~
Syntax:  instaroom
 
Functions the same as instazone, but is room-based instead of area-based.
 
Syntax:  instazone [nodoors]
 
This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.
 
NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.
~

1 INTELLIGENCE INT~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - heavily influences the amount of mana a character gains at level
 
 - affects the amount of mana regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or spell
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage.
~

0 INTERMUD3~
Intermud-3 is a protocol which allows you to chat with people on
other muds who are also connected to Intermud-3. It is primarily
populated by LP based muds at this time, but the hope is to get
more Diku based muds to join over time. While some may say that
Diku based muds would be better served on the IMC Network, it
is far easier for a mud to obtain a connection to the Intermud-3
network, and the commands to use it are generally simpler.
In either case, should a mud desire it, Intermud-3 will coexist
peacefully with an IMC enabled mud. Currently there is no way
for public or private traffic to be passed from one network to
the other.

~

0 INVIS 'MASS INVIS'~
Syntax: cast invis <character>
Syntax: cast 'mass invis'

will become visible when they attack.

The MASS INVIS spell makes all characters in the caster's group invisible,
including the caster.
~

1 ISETUP~
Syntax: isetup add <ice-channel> <localname>   - add a channel
        isetup delete <localname>              - delete a channel
        isetup rename <oldname> <newname>      - rename a channel
        isetup format1 <localname> <format>    - change format1 on a channel
        isetup format2 <localname> <format>    - change format2 on a channel
        isetup level <localname> <level>       - set channel level
 
ISetup allows you to change the local configuration of an ICE
channel. None of these commands have a lasting effect on the channel's
configuration on other muds.
 
ISetup add begins the configuration of a channel. It connects the
specified ice-channel (of the form nodename:channelname) to a local name.
For example: isetup add hub2:IAdmin IAdmin. The local name is also the
command used to speak on the channel.
 
When the channel is added, various default values are filled in for
format1, format2, and level.
 
ISetup delete removes this link. It does not affect the channel itself;
it just deletes the local configuration link for the channel.
 
ISetup rename changes the local name of a channel. It does not affect the
channel name itself for other muds - just the command used locally to
access it.
 
ISetup format1 and format2 change how a channel is displayed locally.
Each format string must have exactly two %s's within it (this is checked
for) - the first will be replaced by the speaker's name, the second by
whatever they say. Format1 is used for normal speech, format2 for emotes.
See ILIST for more information.
 
ISetup level sets the minimum level necessary on your mud to hear or use
the channel.

and elvish in appearance, though they rarely grow over 4 feet tall.  Their
customary weapons include the hoopak and the whippik, and they typically
wear their hair tied up in a topknot.

2 KILLER KILLERFLAG KILLERFLAGS~
&WThe mud will automatically assign you a &PKiller &Wflag if you cause the
death of another player. Only situations which involve peacefuls being
killed by mortals, or &RDeadlies &Wkilling fellow clanmembers will result
in the assignment of this flag. You will receive a &PKiller &Wflag if:
 
  1. You caused the DEATH of another player, regardless of who attacked first.
  To help prevent yourself from acquiring a &PKiller &Wflag after being
  attacked, set yourself to &YConfig +Nice &W(See &CHelp Config &Wfor info).
 
  2. You were the Master of a mobile which killed another player while
  under the influence of your charm. PLEASE NOTE that you will receive a
  &PKiller &Wflag even if the player that died attacked the charmed
  mobile without the Master's permission. Charmers and Pet Owners are held
  responsible for the actions of their Pets/Charmies. (See &CHelp Charm
  &Wand &CHelp Pets &Wfor more info on these topics).

  3. You are a &RDeadly &Wplayer and caused the death of a fellow Clanmember.
 
&WDarkhaven Guards, shopkeepers and special function mobs now respond
differently to illegal flags. You may find yourself barred from making
puchases, placed before Judge Kendra for a hearing, sentenced to
jail, or SLAYED by Harakiem.  You may apply to Judge Kendra in person to
seek removal of the flag. She is located one west of the Main Lobby in

52 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values. The lower the
value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is. Valid
numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.
 
It is suggested that only those items that will occupy the highest value 
slots, or a slot of 0, have any special affects added to them. Underclothing
should only have a.c. settings.

1 LCK LUCK~
Luck (LCK in your 'score') represents the tendency of a character to succeed
or prosper through chance or good fortune.  As in life, the exact extent of
this factor remains and will always remain shrouded in uncertainty...
 
Also as in life, however, it can be said with surety that its influence on a
character is pervasive.  Though it affects some aspects of life here in a
very direct manner, it can affect nearly every aspect to at least a degree.
 
~

0 LEPRECHAUN LEPRECHAUNS~
Leprechauns are said to have been of faerie origin, for their exact nature
is unknown to most.  They tend to be very sensitive to luck, and will not
stay around people they feel to be unlucky.  For this reason, it is considered
good luck to be in the company of a leprechaun.  As a race, they are small
and fun-loving tricksters, nimble-fingered and fleet of foot.  They tend
to be good at magic as well.
~

1 LETHARGY~
Syntax:  c lethargy <victim>
 
Lethargy reduces the victim's dexterity by two.
~

0 LEVEL~
Syntax:  level
 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a spell through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some spells (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 50 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 50 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.

underwater.  They are often noted to use underwater caves as their
lair, and are typically found in swamps, marshes, and similar places.
Members of this race band together in rough tribal form; they are
omnivores, and are likely to prefer human flesh to other foods.
Due to this taste for humans, they suffer if their alignment strays
too much towards the honorable side of the spectrum.

This race, of course, has the innate ability to breath under water.

Lizard men gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.91
~

56 LOADUP~

~

54 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax:  log   <character>
Syntax:  log   all
Syntax:  snoop <character>
 
LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the
server's log file and to the log channel.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent
character toggle that persists across reboots until removed.
 
Certain commands (such as password) are protected against LOG.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.
 
LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.
 
SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
 
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

~

0 MAGICUSER MAGE MAGES~
A mage is one of the weakest classes when it comes to body, but the mage
is a being of pure magic.  Their minds are by far the sharpest, retaining
the knowledge of some of the worlds most powerful spells.  When one begins
as a mage the body is weak.  As they grow in knowledge, experience and
power.  They will become a powerful fighting force.  Armed with an
arsenal of various spells, with the main focus in combat spells.  Their
vast repertoire of spells makes them a sought after commodity in the
Realms for their spells can mean victory or defeat for others.  A mage
must constantly study their spells for they are quickly forgotten, ruled
by the three moons, the silver moon of good, the red moon of neutrality
and the fabled black moon of evil.  A mage has a choice of either using
their powers for good or for evil.
~

1 'MAGNETIC THRUST'~
'Magnetic Thrust,' much like 'Sonic Resonance,' allows the casting
Mage to control the nature of space and time in the immediate locale
of his victim.  In this sorcery, the Mage forms a wedge of magnetic
energy within the body of the victim.  As the spell progresses, the
victims organs are violently rent and internal tissues are torn.  The
resulting pain and damage are formidible, indeed.

100 MEMORIZE~
Memorize is a command that lets you set the location you recall to,
as well as allowing mages with the 'teleport superior' spell to
travel to places they have been before. To see a list of places you
have memorized, type 'memorize list'.
 
By just typing 'memorize' you will begin to memorize the room you
are in as your recall location. It should take a few seconds to
complete. If you want to cancel the memorization, simply enter any
other command and it will stop.
 
Mages with apport arcane or a similar spell may use 'memorize <number>'
to fill the other 7 slots with memorized places. Any character may
memorize rooms in these slots too, but will not be able to use them
without the appropriate spell.

-1 MENTALSTATE MENTALSTATES 'MENTAL STATE' 'MENTAL STATES'~
.
&gYour mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by prolonged combat, hunger, thirst, or poison.  If you are affected by
one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin to
deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly are.
You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, and
your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.
 
To restore your mental state, you may need to rest (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), eat, cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.
Note that if you are malnourished your state will &wnot&g improve, even with
sleep, until you have fed and/or quenched your thirst.
 
Your mental state is by the text line in 'score' which describes your state
of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less accurate
reading of your and your group-mates' mentalstates as well.
 
Note:  Changing your deity now affects your mental state.

0 'MIDON' 'MIDON OUTPOST'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 80

To the east of Darkhaven, many travellers have confirmed the existence
of a path leading northwards to a remote mountain outpost constructed on
a high plateau. Midon Outpost is a popular stop for passing adventurers
and mountain climbers, but the journey should only be attempted by
skilled travellers. Here many useful and unique supplies can be bought.
Naturally, old adventurers also like to tell tails of wild adventure and
spread crazy rumours about the building of the outpost by dwarves on top
of the ruins of an ancient civilization, and of ghosts, dragons, and
angry snow-gods.

Neil Edelman / Metheus built 2002 for SDFMud
Made for ResortMud 4.0, mostly Smaug 1.4 compatible.

have an arrow in inventory.
 
See help &Wfire and help &Wfletch
~

53 MISSILES~
Creating a projectile is basically the same as making any other
weapon. The exception to this are its Values (see ITEMVALUES)
and the need to have missiles which match missileweapons.
 
&GFollow this basic proceedure to make a set of projectiles&W:
  1) Create a firing mechanism, for instance, a long bow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'missileweapon'.
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take missile'
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the Value3 (V3) from the table in HELP WEAPONTYPES.
 
&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the V3 to match the V3 on the firing mechanism you created.
 
Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

 Welcome to the SDFmud!
 There will be major changes to class and race structure being done slowly
 over the next few months. Guilds/Orders/and Clans are going to be shaken
 up a bit as they are restructured. And finally the world itself is going
 to be reformed into a beter place all and all.
 If you have bugs to report, please post them to the bug forum at the SDFmud

102 MOTDHELP~
&WThank you for viewing this file.  It has taken me hours to make the MOTD's
and I think they should stay this way for awhile.  Since I want this style
kept on here, here is a help file I think you should read just in case.
 
All the help files have a format.  The format looks like this:
 
&B    _,.-*-'-*-.,_,.-*-'-*-.,_,.-*-'-*-.,.-*-'-*-.,_,.-*-'-*-.,_,.-*-'-*-.,_
   /                                                                       \
                                   &rR&Ye&Bs&go&Or&Pt&wM&RU&GD&W
&c                              Message of the Day
&W                            Last Updated:  00/00/00&w
&W
&WLines 1-5 is the banner, and the 6th line is blank.  This should be kept
this was to make it look even.  Even the 6th line gives it an even flow.
After that, you have the MOTD to look at.  After the USUAL MOTD you have
something simular to this (it may vary from time to time):
 
&c                                 Visit UCMM at:&B
   \._          http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arena/4066/         _./
      `-*-'-*-.,_,.-*-'-*-.,_,.-*-'-*-.,.-*-'-*-.,_,.-*-'-*-.,_,.-*-'-*-'&W
 
So between this sandwich you have a MOTD.  Remember, please do not delete
what others have posted on the MOTD nor the banners at the top and bottom.
 
Decide how many lines your message will be (only messages of importance),
insert the lines that you need, goto the starting line and edit your heart
out.  If you see that you have overlapped another part of the MOTD, please
type '/a' on a new line and start the process over again.
 
When you are happy with your results (or when you are finished) you have to
set the date on the top of the MOTD to the date of when you edited the MOTD
last (if you are editing today, that would be today's date).  The date is
perfectly centered and should stay that way to keep the flow.  Here is what
you do to change the date (ignore the [']):
 
'/g 5' (This lets you edit line 5)
'/r <old date> <new date>' (This will replace the old date with the one you
                            will replace.  Use the 6 digit date format only.)
'/l' (Look to see if the MOTD looks okay)
'/s' (Saves the buffer)
'hset save' (Remember to save the help file)
 
If you have any questions, please talk to Yakkov or go to room 1260 and
leave a message with his Droid (read the sign in 1260 for more information).

when it goes mobinvis; they cannot see it with any spell, it will be
completely invisible to them.
 
Be warned, however, that its programs will still function as normal, the
mortal will simply see a 'someone' if it performs an action or an echo

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.

visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL4_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

0 NECROMANCER NECROMANCERS~
Necromancers are often thought of as dark and sinister wizards of the dead,
dabbling more in death than in life.  They make their acquaintance more
with those who live only through dark powers, and their control over the
undead is incredible.  It is said that the most powerful of necromancers is
capable of controlling all but the greatest of vampire lords.  These clerics,
of course, also have the capability of raising the dead from their very
graves in order to serve them for a time.

 &z&WA void of darkness and light surrounds you, darkness and light each
vying for possession of your soul.

But then you feel yourself being pulled by an inexorable force, and know
that this is not the end, as you open your eyes again you find yourself
naked, reincarnated in a new body.
 
 &z&WYou hear the voice of a Goddess whisper to you...
 &z&C'When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the Temple Altar
in Darkhaven.  Should you later join a clan or order you will be
reincarnated at your own altar.
 
Your corpse, however, will remain where you were killed, together with
your items, you that you can attempt to return to the scene and retrieve
your items.  Corpses will decay after time, and when this happens the
items within them will be left on the ground for anyone to pick up.

Once you have chosen a deity and gained sufficient favor, you will be
able to supplicate to your deity for your corpse.  Type 'help death'
 
I will give you this message only on your first two deaths...'

 &z&WThe divine voice is gone, and you are left to fend for yourself.

112 'NUISANCE STAGES'~
Stages of nuisances are the affects that the victim picks up while in
that stage.  As time progresses and the victim progresses through the
stages, they pick up new problems and the old ones gradually strengthen.
So for example if they are in stage 3 and progress to stage 4.  They
will feel more affects from stage 1,2 and 3 and pick up the affects from
stage 4. Power level is how hard they get hit with the affect. So if in stage
1 the affect was 2% of the time at power level 1 it may be 4% of the time
in power level 2.  And in stage 2 the affect in stage 1 may be 4% of the
time at power level 1 and 8% of the time at power level 2.
So with that being said here are the current stages and their affects:
Stage 1:  The Thirst Stage 
          This makes them become thirsty quicker.  The formula used is the
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is added to your
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is subtracted from
your thirst each time.  With 100 being not thirsty and 0 being dehydrated.
Stage 2:  The Hunger Stage
          The hunger stage works exactly as above except, the formula
subtracts 1 from the current stage becoming: (<current stage>-1)*<power level>
Stage 3:  The Mentalstate Stage
          In this stage each time your mentalstate worsens nuisance exagerates
the amount you worsen by. The formula used to compute how much more it 
adds or subtracts is: .4*(<current stage>-2)*<power level>.
Stage 4:  The Potion Stage
          In this stage you can not stomach as many potions as you normally
could without the nuisance flag.  Normally if your thirst or hunger is above
48 you can't quaf anymore.  Nuisance makes this a much lower number.
The formula used is: (48-(3*<current stage>)+<power level>)
So at power level 10, stage 10 you could only quaf 8 potions on an empty
stomach.
Stage 5:  The Wait Stage
          In this stage commands start taking longer to complete.  A
normal spell for example takes around 8-15 rounds of wait time.  With this
stage more wait time is added with the following formula:
(<current stage> -4 ) + <power level>    So at Stage 6 at power level 5,
each command would have an additionl 7 wait added to it.
Stage 6:  The Offensive Magic Stage
           In this stage you have a chance of targeting yourself with 
offensive spells instead of whatever target is specified.  The formula
for the percentage or the time you do it is the following:
(<current stage>-5)*8 + <power_level>*6  So at first stage 6 with a power
level of 5 you would have a 38% chance to target yourself with offensive
spells.
Stage 7:  The Defensive Magic Stage
          In this stage, if you are fighting someone you have a chance to
target them with any defensive spells you cast.  The formula used is the
following:  (<current stage>-6)*8 + <power_level>*6

Stage 8:  The Speech Stage
          In this stage you have a chance to scramble your speech and
scramble other peoples speech (IE what you hear from them).  This works
on a percentage with the following formula:
(<current stage>-7)*10*<power level>  So at stage 9 with power level 2
speech is scrambled 40% of the time.
Stage 9:  The Movement Stage
            In this stage you start moving in random directions like a drunk
does.  This is worked out in a percentage as well. Which works of the 
following formula:  (<current stage>-8)*10*<power level>  So in stage 10
with a power level of 4 you would randomly choose an exit 80% of the time.
Stage 10:  The command Stage
           In this stage your commands start failing (Like mentalstate).
This is done on a percentage of the following:
(<current stage>-9)*10*<power level>  So at stage 10, power level 10 the
character becomes utterly useless, as commands will fail 100% of the time.

112 NUISANCE UNNUISANCE~
&WSyntax:
      &cunnuisance  <victim>
      &cnuisance    <victim> [options]
&GUnnuisance will remove the nuisance flag from a player.
Nuisance will add a nuisance flag to the player specified by victim.
&wThis only works on pc's.  The optional parameters are as follows:
  &cmaxtime <#> <minutes/days/hours>&w
         &wThe maxstage of nuisance. Default is 8 days.
  &ctime <#>&w:  The time in days that the nuisance flag will stay on the
         player, once the time is expired the flag will automatically be
         removed. If this option is not used it will default to a permenant
         penalty.
  &cpower <#>&w:  A number from 1 to 10, 10 being the worst for the player.

&WNote the words before the options are not optional and must be used.

&RExamples:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days time 7 power 5
&GThis would nuisance mortal for 7 days with the maximum stage being
reached in 5 days, at a power level of 5.  Also note you can leave options
out:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days power 5 &Gfor example would set the
maximum time to reach the final stage at a power level 5 and use the default
value for the time.  Also options can be rearranged n like:
&cnuisance mortal power 5 maxtime 5 days time 7 &Gwould be the same as the
first example.
&GTo see info on nuisance level, power and set time of a player, use &WMSTAT.

0 NYMPH NYMPHS~
Nymphs are beautiful creates of woods and water, at home in forest, lake
and sea alike.  Also known as naiads, dryads and hamadryads, nereids,
and various other names, nymphs are a gentle race, very friendly even though
they tend to keep to themselves.  They shun all that is evil and dark,
and can never drop below a neutral alignment without suffering mentally.
Because of their attunement to nature, they can see those who are hidden,
and can also breathe underwater.

1 OBJECTS~
To see the objects you currently possess, type INVENTORY and EQUIPMENT.
INVENTORY is anything you are carrying, but are not currently wearing.
EQUIPMENT shows you the equipment you are currently wearing.
 
You may WEAR, WIELD, or HOLD equipment to use it.  To stop using a piece
of equipment, you REMOVE it.  Before you may wield a new weapon, you must
first REMOVE the old weapon. 
 
You can gain information on your objects by using LOOK or EXAMINE.  EXAMINE
tells you the condition of your item, as it is a more detailed form of LOOK.
 
To find out more information on objects, read sections 9, 10 and 17 of your

Sort by object type in ascending order. Display only that eq held
by players - ignore any on mobs or on the ground.
 
ogrub 20 +name name<>gloves
Display all eq with the substring "gloves" in the name field. Sort
by object name. Note that often objects are named with two or three
keywords like "gauntlets steel gloves". The substring operator <>
is used to search fields for substrings.
 
ogrub 20 +cname np ng type=light int>0
Display lights on mobs that raise intelligence. Sort by character name.
Ignore any lights on players or on the ground.

armor class by more than 100 (remember the lower the AC the better)
Sort by object level in ascending order.
 
ogrub 20 or d2 sav0>1 sav1>1 sav2>1 sav3>1 sav4>1
Display equipment that have affects resulting in any saving throws that are
greater than one. Note that positive saving throws are bad for characters

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.

~

51 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that

-1 PALADIN PALADINS~
The Paladin
___________________________________________________________
"You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with
grace, since God has blessed you forever.  Gird your sword upon your side,
O mighty one; clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.
 
In your majesty ride forth victoriously in behalf of truth, humility and
righteousness; let your right hand display awesome deeds. 
 
Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king's enemies; let the
nations fall beneath your feet...
 
You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has 
set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy...
 
I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the
nations will praise you for ever and ever..."
___________________________________________________________
 
Paladins are warrior priests who draw their power from acts of righteousness
and strict adherence to the Code of The Temple of Solomon.  Their strength
in battle, combined with the ability to perform limited miracles is offset
by the difficulty they experience in perfecting their craft, and the penalties
they suffer when they stray from the path of good.
~

0 PANIC~
Syntax:  PANIC
 
All player characters, mortal and Immortal, are set with a function called

help quickly enough to avoid death. 
 
This is where the PANIC command comes in.  When a player finds themself in
mortal danger, they type "PANIC" and IMMPROOF is toggled off and a chat
HELP! message is sent across the mud.  The person in trouble can then be
transferred out of danger by an Immortal or others can come to his or her
rescue.  PANIC is ONLY to be used in emergencies. You MUST try recalling 
first.  PANIC is NOT to be abused.  Any misuse or abuse of PANIC will result
in severe punishment.
 
After the player is rescued and out of danger, IMMPROOF may be turned back
on by typing CONFIG +IMMPROOF.

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax:  password  <new password>   <new password>
 
PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.
The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.
 
&YThe password policy is:  password equals ownership.&w

2 PASSWORD_ZMUD~
When you're using zMUD and want to change your password, remember to change
it in the zMUD character settings as well as on the mud.  The MUD's command
for this is:  password <new password> <new password>
In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is.  Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'.  Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked.  Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter].  Your password will be shown on your
screen, but not sent to the mud.  Write it down, for future reference.

one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

2 RACETALK~
Syntax:  racetalk <message>
 
The racetalk channel will send your message to all the members of
your race currently online.  This channel can be used to roleplay
in accordance with the characteristics of your race, to plan runs
or grouping with a more focused body of players, or for general
chatter.  Please note that racetalk is partially designed to
promote roleplaying, so attempting to limit yourself to the
characteristics of your race may enhance your enjoyment of the mud,
and may provide a unique experience for those who have never
roleplayed previously.

0 RANGER~
A ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times.  A
self-sufficent person, the ranger is adaptable and can survive in almost
any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the finest
armor available, a ranger is physically skilled enough to take on most any
foe.  However, for especially hardy opponents, a ranger also can cast many
useful spells to both hinder his opponent and aid himself.  From minor
curative magics to blinding his enemy, the ranger is the most adept class
at surviving on its own.  A ranger typically travels light, but he does
have the mighty strength of a warrior to carry equipment needed in his
travels.  Like the druid (the class other than warrior that he most
closely resembles), his need for help from outside sources is low.

~

1 'REIMB' 'REIMBURSEMENT'~
Deadly characters are never eligible for Reimbursements.
Experience can _not_ be reimbursed under any circumstances whatsoever.

The following are causes we will NOT reimburse for:
-- Loss of corpse due to corpse decay.  See "help corpse" for details.
-- Loss of corpse due to lag.
-- Loss of corpse due to problems with your system or the net.
-- Individual items lost due not saving your character regularly.
-- Individual items lost due to carrying items above your level.
-- Individual items lost because they were zapped or dropped on the ground.
-- Containers lost because they were left on ground or destroyed by a mob.
-- Weapon loss due to disarm before crash, reboot, or from a mob taking it.
-- Items lost due to hitting a death trap
-- Items lost due to scrapping by mobs or other players
-- Items lost due transferring equipment from one character to another.
-- Items lost due to not saving after looting your corpse and a crash occurs.
 
Corpses are now saved across crashes and reboots, eliminating the need
for most reimbursements due to corpse loss.  The ONLY cause for reimbursement
is when a corpse reappears in the game empty after a crash or reboot.

To apply for a reimbursement post a note on the Oracle Board setting out the
circumstances of the loss and the five items you had prior to loss that you
would like reimbursed.  We will not reimburse certain items, such as gold,
potions, glory, clan items, or more than one weapon.  We will only consider
reimbursement requests made within one hour of a reboot or crash.  Only a
Demi God or higher may do a reimbursement, but any level Immortal may deny
one.  We will attempt to deal with the request as expeditiously as possible.
~

1 REMAINS~
Syntax:  remains
 
A worshipper may request knowledge on the disposition of their remains
from his or her deity (meaning the location and remaining time before
complete decay).  However, the imposition comes at the cost of a small
amount of favor -- approximately twice that of the character's level.
 
If no remains exist, there is no penalty to favor.
 
SEE ALSO:  supplicate
~

0 'REMOVE CURSE'~
Syntax: cast 'remove curse' <character>

character is carrying or using.

0 'REMOVE TRAP'~

0 REMOVE WEAR WIELD HOLD~
Syntax:  hold   <object>
Syntax:  remove <object>
Syntax:  remove all
Syntax:  wear   <object>
Syntax:  wear   all
Syntax:  wield  <object>
 
Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:
 
HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.
 
You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.
 
WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.
 
REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
~

1 RENAME~
A rename may be done by a level 54 or higher immortal.  If you wish
for the rekey to be completed at the same time, you must contact a
level 56 or higher immortal.  The rename can be purchased with 20
glory or a rename scroll.  Wedding renames are done with a marriage
license by Blorin, the Darkhaven engraver.  (See help wedding)
Renames are to be medieval in style for mortals and must not contain
the name of an immortal without their expressed consent.  Items will
not be renamed to machine gun, silly putty, etc.
Before contacting an immortal to redeem glory or scrolls for a rename,
please have in mind what you would like done.  You will need to consider
the following:
Short description - what is seen when the item is worn by a person.
Long description - what is seen when the item is lying on the ground.
Rekey - the renaming of the item (usually something from the short desc)

 &z&RImportant: ANY changing of the short desc, long desc, or keywords--
including adding color--costs 20 glory for all three.

Repair allows you to repair equipment and swords at metal blacksmiths,
and recharge staves and wands at magical 'blacksmiths.'  Repair all
attempts to repair every item in your inventory.
 
There is a 10% surcharge for using "repair all". This surcharge is for

at once.

~

51 RESERVE~
.
The "Reserve" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.
 
We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).
 
We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.
 
reserve                        list current reserved names
reserve joe                    add joe to the list if he's not on it
reserve joe                    remove joe to the list if he is on it

planned in advance or done on request.  The best way to ensure that a

rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  You cannot SAVE and QUIT
with objects of a higher level than your own, as they will vanish when

akin to men.  Found almost exclusively among heavy weed beds in quiet,
sheltered, salty waters, they are great friends of the dolphins.  The
race historically prefers to fashion caverns in lagoon bottoms and
reefs in which to live and work, but the reality of the today's Realms
has forced them into the general populace.

The race is humanoid in appearance, with gill slits on the throat and
greenish-silver skin and green or blue-green hair.  Sea elves have an
inate ability to notice magical auras as well as breath under water.

These are powerful skills which allow a character to attack more than
once per combat round.  Use of these skills is automatic once you have
practiced them.
 
While you can practice the attacks out of turn (third attack before you
have mastered second attack, for example), it is extremely inefficient
to do so.
 
~

1 'SECOND CAST' 'THIRD CAST' 'FOURTH CAST' 'FIFTH CAST' 'SIXTH CAST' 'SEVENTH CAST' 'EIGHTH CAST'~
A player with knowledge of these skills will automatically cast an
offensive spell multiple times rather than a single time, at a
reduced mana cost than casting them that number of times.  These skills
work much like second attack does for attacks, and are automatic once
practiced.

57 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

1 SMAUG~
To create your first level 65 character -- the initial immortal -- for
the current release of Smaug (which was released with name authorization
activated), perform the following:
 
  Using pico, joe, vi or some other text editor, load sysdata.dat and
  change "Waitforauth    1" to "Waitforauth    0".  This will disable
  the name authorization system, and characters will appear in the
  academy and be advanced from level 1 to level 2.
 
  Once you've made such a character and it is advanced to level 2, go
  in to the corresponding player directory, load the pfile, and edit
  its level to 65.
 
You're now ready to log your level 65 in to your mud and proceed.
To subscribe to the Smaug mail list, send mail to smaug-request@realms.game.org

~

1 SMAUG1~
To get SMAUG running under Windows 95, perform the following
steps, in order.
1.  Download the following files from ftp.game.org/pub/smaug
    to C:\
       SMAUG1.02.TGZ
       SMAUGw32.ZIP OR SMAUGW32_1_02A.ZIP
       Note: The two zip files are mutually exclusive. One
       file has routines for CRYPTO.  See the index on the
       ftp site for details.  Download only the latest
       version of the programs.
2.  Download an UNTGZ program and a copy of mIRC or identd from a
    web site that has them. IF your uncompression program is able
    to handle both zip and tgz files, this step may be unnecessary.
3.  With SMAUG1.02.TGZ in your C:\ root directory, UNTGZ the file.
    This will build the directories needed for SMAUG.
See &Whelp smaug2 &w for Windows information
 
~

1 SMAUG2~
.
4.  Copy or move the smaug zip file into C:\DIST\SYSTEM and unzip
    the file.
5.  Copy C:\DIST\SYSTEM\cygwin.dll to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM
6.  Copy the .ARE and .LST files into C:\DIST\SYSTEM
7.  Run mIRC/identd software and minimize the window.  This handles
    the addressing routines.  If it is not active, you may experience
    alot of lag as the system attempts to resolve the addressing fo
    the screen displays and responses.
8.  Open a DOS window and set your memory configuration to place as
    much of your memory into EXTENDED memory allocation as possible.
 
9.  To run SMAUG, you can either:
    a)  Open a DOS window, go to C:\DIST\SYSTEM and type SMAUG.
    b)  In windows, go to C:\DIST and double click on the SMAUG.EXE
        file.
10.  Using a client, sign on to your new MUD using 127.0.0.1 port 4000.

1 'SOLAR FLIGHT'~
Syntax:  c 'solar flight' <victim>
 
This spell allows the caster to merge from an outdoor area to their victim
in an outdoor area.
 
The spell has a few restrictions:  you will only succeed in casting it
during daytime hours, between 7 A.M. and 5 P.M. and you will only succeed
in casting if both you and your victim are in an outdoor area -- you need
the power of the sun in order for this spell to work (thus it will also

~

1 SPAM SPAMMING~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to ***PUT A LID ON IT!!!*** and force-quit you after 
the 20th repeat of a single command.
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered spam.
ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be considered
spam.
~

1 SPEAK LANGUAGE~
Syntax:  speak
Syntax:  speak <language>
Syntax:  speak all (immortals only)

language (such as common, for example), type "speak common".

1 'SPECTRAL FUROR' 'HAND OF CHAOS'~
After the Dark Mage Thanatos accidentally discovered the spell
'Disruption' in a failed attempt to create a teleportation magic,
he spent many years studying how to increase the pain that can
be inflicted by incorrectly moving a victim across the threshold
of dimensions.  
 
 'Spectral Furor' is a formula which, by upsetting the very nature
of the space the victim inhabits causes neural as well as brute
physical damage.
 
With 'Hand of Chaos,' Thanatos perfected this line of magic, and he
returned to his researches on the art of astral travel.
~

56 SPELLCOMPONENTS~
T###         check for item of type ###

% decrease component's value[3], and extract if it reaches 0
decrease component's value[4], and extract if it reaches 0

1100 and 1101.  The object of vnum 1100 will get consumed by the spell,

They are tiny, winged, and highly intelligent, delighting in spells and

0 THIEF THIEVES~
The thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society. Known to haunt the darkest roads and
alleys. The skills of the thief reflect his way of life, be it sneaking,
peeking into others' inventories, picking locks, or attacking from behind
with deadly backstabs. With amazing dexterity they have the ability to
circle around an enemy, but for living such a dark life, thieves have
always had a bad reputation so don't be suprised if you are always under
suspicion. Thieves start off fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as
backstab and circle they soon become dangerous foes.  A thief is always
useful when there is  a lock that needs pryed, or an item that one wishes
to acquire without detection.
 
~

58 THINK~
Syntax:  think <message>
 
Allows you to use the 'think' channel, which functions the same as all
other channels and can only be seen by those of high enough level.
The level for access to think can be controlled with 'cset'.
 
See CSET
~

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the Realms are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.
 
Area resitting will not happen unless the number of mobs in the game gets
low.  Mobs and objects, however, will reset separately, so the number of
objects in the game also will not reset until it grows low.
 
Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.
 
~

65 TIMECMD~
Syntax:  timecmd <command>
Example: timecmd mpstat <mob>

105 TRIGGER~
A trigger is an action, phrase, or game event that causes a program
held within a room, mob or object, to begin playing out its commands.
 
Triggers can be anything from a player or mob entering a room, to a
player stating a particular phrase within a room, or to a mob or an
object.
 
For detailed information on triggers, see:
 
RPTRIGGERS, MPTRIGGERS, OPTRIGGERS
~

0 TROGLODYTE TROGLODYTES~
Primitive creatures vaguely resembling how humans theoretically may have
been at some point in ancient history.  They tend to live in caves, and have
no use for technology or magic, relying solely upon their own stone tools
and thick skulls to carry them through the day.  They tend to be very strong,
however, and fight well, for they often hunt their prey with their bare hands
and wrestle it to the ground.
~

0 'TROLLISH VIGOR' TROLLISH VIGOR~
This spell increases your stamina during its duration.
~

1 TRUE TRUESIGHT~
Syntax:  cast truesight
Syntax:  c true
 
Truesight confers the caster with a very brief immunity to blindness
(from attacks such as gouge or the blindness spell itself).  While
under the spell's effect, the caster continues to see.  Be warned
that when the spell wears off the caster will become blind should
the effects of the blinding attack still remain.
Truesight cannot be cast on anyone but the caster itself.
~

111 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

~

1 TUMBLE~
Syntax:  operates independently
 
Tumble is a high-level thief skill for the evasion of incoming attacks.
The skill functions autonomically, and its effectiveness is greater for
more dexterous thieves.
 
~

59 UNFOLDAREA~
Syntax:  unfoldarea <area filename>
 
This command will load up an area file.
 
NOTE:  It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already
       loaded, or one that has not been tested.
 
~

1 'UNRAVEL DEFENSE'~
Syntax: c 'unravel defense' <victim>
 
This spell renders the victim susceptible to both magic and nonmagic attacks.
~

1 UPLIFT~
Syntax:  c uplift <target>
 
Uplift is a cleric spell that can heal from afar, meant to be used in 
aiding players with negative hitpoints.
Uplift is not to be used as your common mode of healing.  Repeatedly asking
for uplifts on public channels is spammy and annoying for other players.  
Keep in mind that the clerics that are uplifting you are doing so out of 
kindness.  Do _not_ abuse it or consider it a right.
~

54 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

112 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.
~

0 VALIANCE~
This spell increases your perserverence when you are on the verge of
losing consciousness.
~

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
.
Vampires are one of the powerful creatures of the Realms.  Being a creature
of the undead, they require copious quantities of fresh blood.  Instead of
using mana, Vampires use blood points (bp) for spell casting.  If a Vampire
takes a large amount of damage, Blood points will be lost, but, Blood points
can give a small surge of hit points (hp) in battle when needed.  As a undead
creature of the night, Vampires recieve an armor class (ac) bonus at night,
a time when they can use the skill mistwalk.

105 VARIABLES~
This is the list of variables to be used in actiondescs for objects and in
mob/room/object programs.

~

0 VENTRILOQUATE~
Syntax: cast ventriloquate <speaker> <message>

This spell throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or
character in the room is saying your message.  Victims who make their saving
throw will know that someone is using ventriloquism, but not who.  Victims who
fail their saving throw will think that the object or character really did say
your message.
~

1 VISION NIGHTVISION~
Syntax: nightvision
 
This skill allows one with it to see in the dark.
 
Syntax: vision
 
By use of this ancient and secretive skill, a person may summon
up the knowledge of the ages to see many things.
However, the use of this skill is unpredictable, and the results
are not always the same.
~

1 VITALIZE~
Syntax: c vital
 
This spell will regenerate the caster's mana, at a great cost to
movement. This spell requires a holy symbol through which to
channel the energy.
~

105 VNUMS~
Syntax: vnums [low] [high]

Lists the vnum range for rooms/mobs/objects in all prototype areas.
~

1 'VOMICA PRAVUS'~
Syntax:  vomica <victim>
    or:  vom    <victim>
 
A truly depraved afflicition which may be inflicted by a vampire upon
its victim, this curse will weaken an opponent's hitroll and damage
roll, deprive them of precious luck and curse them for a brief time.
The damroll and hitroll affects of this curse increase with the level
of the vampire.
~

1 VOTING VOTE VOTES~
Syntax:  note vote <number> open/close/yes/no/undecided
 
Once a note has been posted on a bulletin board, the author may open
voting with 'note vote <number> open'.  All those who can read the
board may then vote on the issue in the note with 'note vote <number>
yes/no/abstain'. The author may close the voting; the syntax for that
should be clear enough.
 
Note list will show whether a note is not a voting note, open to voting
or closed to voting.  The character that separates the author and the
recipient in 'note list' will be a colon, a capital V or a capital C
accordingly.
~

105 VSEARCH~
Syntax: Vsearch <vnum>
 
This command will list all instances of an object with that vnum that
are currently in the game. 
~

1 WAR WARTALK~
Syntax:  war <message>
 
Wartalk is a channel created as a haven for those players who like to openly
discuss their exploits in combat - and brag against their opponents.  It is
most often used for those who declare war on other deadlies and is desirable
for those who like to invite others to battles in player versus player
whether it be in the arena or around the Realms.
 
Wartalk can be seen by all players in the game, and has the same
rules as other channels.  No harassment, profanity, spamming, or
inappropriate subject matter.
~

58 WARN ~
Syntax: warn class <field>
Syntax: warn race  <field>
Syntax: warn site  <field>
Field is either #(ban_number) or the site/class/race.
Example:  warn class #1
~

0 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warriors are the epitome of fighters, able to use all weaponry and armour
in the exercise of their most lethal of combat skills.  A warrior must be
strong in body to survive his dangerous lifestyle, and though he has no
magic and limited skills he is nevertheless a formidable force with which
to be reckoned.  Warriors learn no magic, and have no use for mana.
 
~

51 WATCH~
. &w
&W Syntax: &G watch                  &W Shows you a help screen
&W Syntax: &G watch size             &W Shows the size of your watch file
&W Syntax: &G watch clear            &W Deletes your watch file
&W Syntax: &G watch show             &W Shows all your active watches
&W Syntax: &G watch player <name>    &W Starts watching a player
&W Syntax: &G watch site <site>      &W Starts watching all players from site
&W Syntax: &G watch delete <number>  &W Stops a watch
&W Syntax: &G watch print 1          &W Shows file starting at line 1
&W Syntax: &G watch print 500        &W Shows file starting at line 500
&W Syntax: &G watch print 500 100    &W Shows 100 lines starting at line 500

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site.
 
We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.
 
~

0 WEAKEN~
Syntax: cast weaken <victim>

This spell will cause the muscles of the victim to grow weak,

~

1 WEAPONS~
Weapons are the primary source of fighting power for most classes,
especially at lower levels where other skills and spells remain
unlearned. To use a weapon, simply 'wield <weapon name>'. You will
hit more frequently with a weapon which is suited to your class, so
choose your weapon wisely. For instance, mages use short blades at 95%
efficiency. A mage wielding a long blade would hit his/her target less
frequently, dependant upon the hitroll of the weapon in hand. Also, be
sure to practice and adept your favored weapontype for best results.
~

53 WEAPONTYPES~
For items of type "weapon", the value3 field specifies the weapon type:

102 WEIGHT HEIGHT~
To change the measurments of a player (not mobs), use these commands:
 
mset <victim> weight <weight in pounds>
mset <victim> height <in inches>
 
Lets use an example.  In real life I (Yakkov) am 5' 10" and weigh 280 pounds.
So, I would MSET my character this way:
 
mset Yakkov weight 280
mset Yakkov height 70
save
 
(You can use SELF instead of your name, if you are editing yourself.)
 
VALUE     WEIGHT     WEIGHT
 
MINIMUM   10 lbs.    0' 10"
MAXIMUM   500 lbs.   8' 4"

If you want a MOB to look like a PLAYER (a trick of the eye), think of some
realistic heights and weights and add them to a MOB description.  Just like
if you look at a player.  Make it look identical.
 
See MSET
~

0 WEREWOLF WEREWOLVES~
In the light of the full moon it is said some men turn into beasts and
prowl the night who otherwise appear to be human by day.  But those are the
legends of other lands, lands where magic is less real, for the truth of
werewolves may be far more terriflying.  They hunt the night and call to
the moon and stars, their talons and fangs razorsharp and their vision
unmatched by any human.  None, it is said, can stop a werewolf stalking its
prey, for their sense of scent is very sensitive and they are capable of
tracking trails any human would miss.

102 WIZINVIS~
All immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is called
for, the following are parameters for its use:
 
 - Immortals level 51 through 54 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.
 
 - Immortals level 55 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 55 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 51 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 51 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someones in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 54 in
Muse, no higher than 51 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.
 
The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.
