Locker Room~
You stand in a locker room.  This is where users may store thier goods.  As you
can see, the walls of the room is completely covered by tiles.  The air is very
musty and humid, almost like it is a sewer. There is a sign on the wall.

Hell~
Now you've done it... the gods must have truly forsaken you, to have sent
you straight to hell!
   It is highly advised to wait here to make your appeal to the wrath of the
gods... or face being damned to hell for all eternity!

The Arena~
You stand in the direct center of the Arena.  Blood pools around your
feet, and you almost slip in this morbid mess.  The stench of death
surrounds you, momentarily blocking from your mind the realization
that you could be attacked from any conceivable direction.  Spinning
slowly about, you realize the poor tactical position you hold.

The Halls of Combat~
You stand in a massive hallway before the great Arena.  Cheers and jeers
from the assembled throngs rise and fall through the corridors.  Lounging
around the hall with you are several other individuals awaiting their own
chance at glory, honor, and spoils beyond the great doors.  The Arena is
dangerous, though, and battles are often to the death.  Once you leave
this room, there is no turning back.....
